<h2>THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA</h2>
<p class="center">(<i>Boston Herald</i>, May
17, 1894)</p>
<p>The Brahmin monk, Swami Vivekananda, lectured yesterday
afternoon in Association Hall on "The Religions of India", in aid of
the Ward 16 Day Nursery. There was a large attendance. </p>
<p>The speaker first gave an account of the Mahommedans, who
formed, he said, one-fifth of the population. They believed in both Old
and New Testaments, but Jesus Christ they regarded only as a prophet.
They had no church organization, though there was reading of the Koran.
</p>
<p>The Parsees, another race, called their sacred book the
Zend-Avesta, and believed in two warring deities, Armuzd the good and
Ahriman the evil. They believed that finally the good would triumph
over the evil. Their moral code was summed up in the words: "Good
thought, good words, good deeds." </p>
<p>The Hindus proper looked up to the Vedas as their religious
scripture. They held each individual to the customs of caste, but gave
him full liberty to think for himself in religious matters. A part of
their method was to seek out some holy man or prophet in order to take
advantage of the spiritual current that flowed through him. </p>
<p>The Hindus had three different schools of religion &#8212; the
dualistic, the qualified monistic and the monistic &#8212; and these<!--'Volume 2 Page 491'-->
three were regarded as stages through which each individual naturally
passed in the course of his religious development. </p>
<p>All three believed in God, but the dualistic school believed
that God and man were separate entities, while the monistic declared
that there was only one existence in the universe, this unitary
existence teeing neither God nor soul, but something beyond. </p>
<p>The lecturer quoted from the Vedas to show the character of
the Hindu religion, and declared that, to find God, one must search
one's own heart. </p>
<p>Religion did not consist of pamphlets or books; it consisted
of looking into the human heart, and finding there the truths of God
and immortality. "Whomsoever I like," said the Vedas, "him I create a
prophet," and to be a prophet was all there was of religion. </p>
<p>The speaker brought his lecture to a close by giving an
account of the Jains, who show remarkable kindness to dumb animals, and
whose moral law is summed up in the words: "Not to injure others is the
highest good."</p>
