<h2>LESS DOCTRINE AND MORE BREAD</h2>
<p class="center">(<i>Baltimore American</i>,
October 15, 1894)</p>
<p>The Lyceum Theater was crowded last night at the first of a
series of meetings by the Vrooman Brothers. The subject discussed was
"Dynamic Religion". </p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda, the high priest [?] from India, was the
last speaker. He spoke briefly, and was listened to with marked
attention. His English and his mode of delivery were excellent. There
is a foreign accent to his syllables, but not enough to prevent him
from being plainly understood. He was dressed in the costume of his
native country, which was decidedly picturesque. He said he could speak
but briefly after the oratory that had preceded him, but he could add
his endorsement to all that had been said. He had traveled a great
deal, and preached to all kinds of<!--'Volume 2 Page 493'-->
people. He had found that the particular kind of doctrine preached made
little difference. What is wanted is practical sort of work. If such
ideas could not be carried out, he would lose his faith in humanity.
The cry all over the world is "less doctrine and more bread". He
thought the sending of missionaries to India all right; he had no
objections to offer, but he thought it would be better to send fewer
men and more money. So far as India was concerned, she had religious
doctrine to spare. Living up to the doctrines was needed more than more
doctrines. The people of India, as well as the people all over the
world, had been taught to pray, but prayer with the lips was not
enough; people should pray with their hearts. "A few people in the
world," he said, "really try to do good. Others look on and applaud,
and think that they themselves have done great good. Life is love, and
when a man ceases to do good to others, he is dead spiritually." </p>
<p>On Sunday evening next Swami Vivekananda will make the address
of the evening at the Lyceum.</p>

<p>Vivekananda sat on the stage last night with imperturbable
stolidity until it came his turn to speak. Then his manner changed and
he spoke with force and feeling. He followed the Vrooman brothers and
said there was little to add to what had been said save his testimony
as a "man from the Antipodes". </p>
<p>"We have doctrines enough," he continued. "What we want now is
practical work as presented in these speeches. When asked about the
missionaries sent to India I reply all right. But we want money more
and men less. India has bushels full of doctrines and to spare. What is
wanted is the means to carry them out. </p>
<p>"Prayer may be done in different ways. Prayer with the hands
is yet higher than prayer with the lips and is more saving. </p>
<!--'Volume 2 Page 494'-->
<p>"All religions teach us to do good for our brothers. Doing
good is nothing extraordinary &#8212; it is the only way to live. Everything
in nature tends to expansion for life and contraction for death. It is
the same in religion. Do good by helping others without ulterior
motives. The moment this ceases contraction and death follow."</p>
