<h2>SOME CUSTOMS OF THE HINDUS</h2>
<p class="center">(<i>Brooklyn Standard Union</i>,
April 8, 1895)</p>
<p>A special meeting of the Brooklyn Ethical Association with an
address by Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk as the main feature, was
held at the Pouch Gallery, of Clinton avenue, last night. "Some customs
of the Hindus what they mean, and how they are misinterpreted," was the
subject treated. A large throng of people filled the spacious gallery. </p>
<p>Dressed in his Oriental costume, his eyes bright, and a flush
mantling his face, Swami Vivekananda started to tell of his people, of
his country, and its customs. He desired only that justice be shown to
him and to his. In the beginning of his discourse he said he would give
a general idea of India. He said it was not a country but a continent;
that erroneous ideas had been promulgated by travellers who had never
seen the country. He said that there were nine separate languages
spoken and over 100 different dialects. He spoke severely of those who
wrote about his country, and said their brains were addled by
superstition, and that they had an idea that everyone outside of the
pale of their own religion was a horrible blackguard. One of the
customs that had often been misinterpreted was the brushing of the
teeth by the Hindus. They never put hair or skin in their mouths, but
use a plant. "Hence a man wrote," said the speaker, "that the Hindus
get up early in the morning and swallow a plant." He said the [custom
of widows throwing themselves under the] car of juggernaut did not
exist, never had, and that no one knew how such a story started. </p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda's talk on caste was most comprehensive and
interesting. He said it was not a granted [graded] system of classes,
but that each caste thought itself to be superior to all the others. He
said it was a trade guild and not a religious institution. He said that
it had been<!--'Volume 2 Page 516'--> in existence from
time immemorial, and explained how at first only certain rights were
hereditary, but how afterward the ties were bound closer, and
intermarriage and eating and drinking were restricted to each caste. </p>
<p>The speaker told of the effect that the mere presence of a
Christian or Mohammedan would have on a Hindu household. He said that
it was veritable pollution for a white man to step into a Hindu's
presence, and that after receiving one outside of his religion, the
Hindu always took a bath. </p>
<p>The Hindu monk abused [?] the order of the Pariahs roundly,
saying they did all the menial work, ate carrion and were the
scavengers. He also said that the people who wrote books on India came
only into contact with these people, and not with genuine Hindus. He
described the trial of one who broke the rules of caste, and said that
the only punishment inflicted was the refusal of the particular caste
to intermarry or drink or eat with him or his children. All other ideas
were erroneous. </p>
<p>In explaining the defects of caste, the speaker said that in
preventing competition it produced stagnation, and completely blocked
the progress of the people. He said that in taking away brutality it
stopped social improvements. In checking competition it increased
population. In its favor, he said, were the facts that it was the only
ideal of equality and fraternity. That money had nothing to do with
social standing in the caste. All were equal. He said that the fault of
all the great reformers was that they thought caste was due only to
religious representation, instead of ascribing it to the right source,
namely, the curious social conditions. He spoke very bitterly of the
attempts of the English and Mohammedans to civilize the country by the
bayonet and fire and sword. He said that to abolish caste one must
change the social conditions completely ant destroy the entire economic
system of the country. Better, he said, that the waves of the [Bay of]<!--'Volume 2 Page 517'-->
Bengal flow and drown all rather than this. English civilization was
composed of the three "B's" &#8212; Bible, bayonet, and brandy. "That is
civilization, and it has been carried to such an extent that the
average income of a Hindu is 50 cents a month. Russia is outside,
saying. 'Let's civilize a little,' and England goes on and on." </p>
<p>The monk grew excited as he walked up and down, talking
rapidly about the way the Hindus had been treated. He scored the
foreign educated Hindus, and described their return to their native
land, "full of champagne and new ideas". He said that child-marriage
was bad, because the West said so, and that the mother-in-law could
torture her daughter-in-law with impunity, as the son could not
interfere. He said that the foreigners took every opportunity to abuse
the heathen, because they had so many evils of their own that they
wanted to cover them up. He said that each nation must work out its own
salvation, and that no one else could solve its problems. </p>
<p>In speaking of India's benefactors he asked whether America
had ever heard of David Herr [Hare], who established the first college
for women, and who had devoted so much of his life to education. </p>
<p>The speaker gave a number of Indian proverbs that were not at
all complimentary to the English. In closing he made an earnest appeal
for his land. He said: </p>
<p>"It matters not as long as India is true to herself and to her
religion. But a blow has been struck at her heart by this awful godless
West when she sends hypocrisy and atheism into her midst. Instead of
sending bushels of abuses, carloads of vituperation and shiploads of
condemnations, let an endless stream of love go forth. Let us all be
men"</p>
