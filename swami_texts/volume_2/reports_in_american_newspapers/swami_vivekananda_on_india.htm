<h2>SWAMI VIVEKANANDA ON INDIA</h2>
<p class="center">(Bay City <i>Daily Tribune</i>,
March 21, 1894)</p>
<p>Bay City had a distinguished visitor yesterday in the person
of Swami Vive Kananda, the much talked of Hindoo monk. He arrived at
noon from Detroit where he has been the guest of Senator Palmer and
proceeded immediately to the Fraser house. There he was seen by a
reporter for <i>The Tribune</i>. </p>
<p>Kananda spoke entertainingly of his country and his
impressions of this country. He came to America via the Pacific and
will return via the Atlantic. "This is a great land," he said, "but I
wouldn't like to live here. Americans think too much of money. They
give it preference over everything else. Your people have much to
learn. When your nation is as old as ours you will be wiser. I like
Chicago very much and Detroit is a nice place." </p>
<p>Asked how long he intended remaining in America, he replied:
"I do not know. I am trying to see most of your country. I go east next
and will spend some time at Boston and New York. I have visited Boston
but not to stay. When I have seen America I shall go to Europe. I am
very anxious to visit Europe. I have never been there." </p>
<p>Concerning himself the easterner said he was 30 years old. He
was born at Calcutta and educated at a college in that city. His
profession calls him to all parts of the country, and he is at all
times the guest of the nation.</p>
<!--'Volume 2 Page 480'-->
<p>India has a population of 285,000,000," he said. "Of these
about 65,000,000 are Mohammedans and most of the others Hindoos. There
are only about 600,000 Christians in the country, and of these at least
250,000 are Catholics. Our people do not, as a rule, embrace
Christianity; they are satisfied with their own religion. Some go into
Christianity for mercenary motives. They are free to do as they wish.
We say let everybody have his own faith. We are a cunning nation. We do
not believe in bloodshed. There are wicked men in our country and they
are in the majority, same as in your country. It is unreasonable to
expect people to be angels." </p>
<p>Vive Kananda will lecture in Saginaw to-night</p>
<p class="center">LECTURE LAST NIGHT</p>
<p>The lower floor of the opera house was comfortably filled when
the lecture began last evening. Promptly at 8:15 o'clock Swami Vive
Kananda made his appearance on the stage, dressed in his beautiful
oriental costume. He was introduced in a few words by Dr. C. T.
Newkirk. </p>
<p>The first part of the discourse consisted of an explanation of
the different religions of India and of the theory of transmigration of
souls. In connection with the latter, the speaker said it was on the
same basis as the theory of conservation was to the scientist. This
latter theory, he said, was first produced by a philosopher of his
country. They did not believe in a creation. A creation implied making
something out of nothing. That was impossible. There was no beginning
of creation, just as there was no beginning of time. God and creation
are as two lines &#8212; without end, without beginning, without [?]
parallel. Their theory of creation is, "It is, was, and is to be." They
think all punishment is but re-action. If we put our hand in the fire
it is burned. That is the re-action of the action. The future condition
of life is determined by the present<!--'Volume 2 Page 481'-->
condition. They do not believe God punishes. "You, in this land," said
the speaker, "praise the man who does not get angry and denounce the
man who does become angry. And yet thousands of people throughout this
country are every day accusing God of being angry. Everybody denounces
Nero, who sat and played on his instrument while Rome was burning, and
yet thousands of your people are accusing God of doing the same thing
today." </p>
<p>The Hindoos have no theory of redemption in their religion.
Christ is only to show the way. Every man and woman is a divine being,
but covered as though by a screen, which their religion is trying to
remove. The removal of that Christians call salvation, they, freedom.
God is the creator, preserver, and destroyer of the universe. </p>
<p>The speaker then sought to vindicate the religions of his
country. He said it had been proven that the entire system of the Roman
Catholic Church had been taken from the books of Buddhism. The people
of the west should learn one thing from India &#8212; toleration. </p>
<p>Among other subjects which he held up and overhauled were: The
Christian missionaries, the zeal of the Presbyterian church and its
non-toleration, the dollar-worshipping in this country, and the
priests. The latter he said were in the business for the dollars there
were in it, and wanted to know how long they would stay in the church
if they had to depend on getting their pay from God. After speaking
briefly on the Caste system in India, our civilization in the south,
our general knowledge of the mind, and various other topics the speaker
concluded his remarks.</p>
