<h2>SECTS AND DOCTRINES IN INDIA</h2>
<p class="center">(<i>Harvard Crimson</i>, May
17, 1894)</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda, the Hindoo monk, gave an address last
evening in Sever Hall under the auspices of the Harvard Religious
Union. The address was very interesting, the clear and eloquent voice
of the speaker, and his low, earnest delivery making his words
singularly impressive. </p>
<p>There are various sects and doctrines in India, said
Vivekananda, some of which accept the theory of a personal God, and
others which believe that God and the universe are one; but whatever
sect the Hindoo belongs to he does<!--'Volume 2 Page 492'-->
not say that his is the only right belief, and that all others must be
wrong. He believes that there are many ways of coming to God; that a
man who is truly religious rises above the petty quarrels of sects or
creed. In India if a man believes that he is a spirit, a soul, and not
a body, then he is said to have religion and not till then. </p>
<p>To become a monk in India it is necessary to lose all thought
of the body; to look upon other human beings as souls. So monks can
never marry. Two vows are taken when a man becomes a monk, poverty and
chastity. He is not allowed to receive or possess any money whatever.
The first ceremony to be performed on joining the order is to be burnt
in effigy, which supposed to destroy once for all the old body, name
and caste. The man then receives a new name, and is allowed to go forth
and preach or travel, but must take no money for what he does.</p>
