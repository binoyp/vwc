<h2>INDIA'S GIFT TO THE WORLD</h2>
<p class="center">(<i>Brooklyn Standard Union</i>,
February 27, 1895)</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda, the Hindoo monk, delivered a lecture Monday
night under the auspices of the Brooklyn Ethical Association before a
fairly large audience at the hall of the Long Island Historical
Society, corner Pierrepont and Clinton streets. His subject was
"India's Gift to the World". </p>
<p>He spoke of the wondrous beauties of his native land, "where
stood the earliest cradle of ethics, arts, sciences, and literature,
and the integrity of whose sons and the virtue of whose daughters have
been sung by all travelers." Then the lecturer showed in rapid details,
what India has given to the world. </p>
<p>"In religion," he said, "she has exerted a great influence on
Christianity, as the very teachings of Christ would [could] be traced
back to those of Buddha." He showed by quotations from the works of
European and American scientists the many points of similarity between
Buddha and Christ. The latter's birth, his seclusion from the world,
the number of his apostles, and the very ethics of his teachings are
the same as those of Buddha, living many hundred years before him. </p>
<p>"Is it mere chance," the lecturer asked, "or was<!--'Volume 2 Page 511'-->
Buddha's religion but the foreshadowing of that of Christ? The majority
of your thinkers seem to be satisfied in the latter explanation, but
there are some bold enough to say that Christianity is the direct
offspring of Buddhism just as the earliest heresy in the Christian
religion &#8212; the Monecian [Manichaean] heresy &#8212; is now universally
regarded as the teaching of a sect of Buddhists. But there is more
evidence that Christianity is founded in Buddhism. We find it in
recently discovered inscriptions from the reign of Emperor Oshoka
[Asoka] of India, about 300 B.C., who made treaties with all the
Grecian kings, and whose missionaries discriminated [disseminated ?] in
those very parts, where, centuries after, Christianity flourished, the
principles of the Buddhistic religion. Thus it is explained, why you
have our doctrine of trinity, of incarnation of God, and of our ethics,
and why the service in our temples is so much alike to that in your
present Catholic churches, from the mass to the chant and benediction.
Buddhism had all these long before you. Now use your own judgment on
these premise &#8212; we Hindoos stand ready to be convinced that yours is
the earlier religion, although we had ours some three hundred years
before yours was even thought of. </p>
<p>"The same holds good with respect to sciences. India has given
to antiquity the earliest scientifical physicians, and, according to
Sir William Hunter, she has even contributed to modern medical science
by the discovery of various chemicals and by teaching you how to reform
misshapen ears and noses. Even more it has done in mathematics, for
algebra, geometry, astronomy, and the triumph of modern science &#8212; mixed
mathematics &#8212; were all invented in India, just so much as the ten
numerals, the very cornerstone of all present civilization, were
discovered in India, and are in reality, Sanskrit words. </p>
<p>"In philosophy we are even now head and shoulders above any
other nation, as Schopenhauer, the great German philosopher, has
confessed. In music India gave to the<!--'Volume 2 Page 512'-->
world her system of notation, with the seven cardinal notes and the
diatonic scale, all of which we enjoyed as early as 350 B.C., while it
came to Europe only in the eleventh century. In philology, our Sanskrit
language is now universally acknowledged to be the foundation of all
European languages, which, in fact, are nothing but jargonized
Sanskrit. </p>
<p>"In literature, our epics and poems and dramas rank as high as
those of any language; our 'Shaguntala' [<i>Shakuntala</i>]
was summarized by Germany's greatest poet, as 'heaven and earth
united'. India has given to the world the fables of Aesop, which were
copied by Aesop from an old Sanskrit book; it has given the Arabian
Nights, yes, even the story of Cinderella and the Bean Stalks. In
manufacture, India was the first to make cotton and purple [dye], it
was proficient in all works of jewelry, and the very word 'sugar', as
well as the article itself, is the product of India. Lastly she has
invented the game of chess and the cards and the dice. So great, in
fact, was the superiority of India in every respect, that it drew to
her borders the hungry cohorts of Europe, and thereby indirectly
brought about the discovery of America. </p>
<p>"And now, what has the world given to India in return for all
that? Nothing but nullification [vilification] and curse and contempt.
The world waded in her children's life-blood, it reduced India to
poverty and her sons and daughters to slavery, and now it adds insult
to injury by preaching to her a religion which can only thrive on the
destruction of every other religion. But India is not afraid. It does
not beg for mercy at the hands of any nation. Our only fault is that we
cannot: fight to conquer; but we trust in the eternity of truth.
India's message to the world is first of all, her blessing; she is
returning good for the evil which is done her, and thus she puts into
execution this noble idea, which had its origin in India. Lastly,
India's message is, that calm goodness, patience and gentleness will<!--'Volume 2 Page 513'-->
ultimately triumph. For where are the Greeks, the onetime masters of
the earth? They are gone. Where are the Romans, at the tramp of whose
cohorts the world trembled? Passed away. Where are the Arabs, who in
fifty years had carried their banners from the Atlantic to the Pacific?
and where are the Spaniards, the cruel murderers of millions of men?
Both races are nearly extinct; but thanks to the morality of her
children, the kinder race will never perish, and she will yet see the
hour of her triumph." </p>
<p>At the close of the lecture, which was warmly applauded, Swami
Vivekananda answered a number of questions in regard to the customs of
India. He denied positively the truth of the statement published in
yesterday's [February 25] <i>Standard Union</i>, to the
effect that widows are ill-treated in India. The law guarantees her not
only her own property, before marriage, but also all she received from
her husband, at whose death, if there be no direct heirs, the property
goes to her. Widows seldom marry in India, because of the scarcity of
men. He also stated that the self-sacrifices of wives at the death of
their husbands as well as the fanatical self-destruction under the
wheels of the Juggernaut, have wholly stopped, and referred his hearers
for proof to Sir William Hunter's "History of the Indian Empire".</p>
