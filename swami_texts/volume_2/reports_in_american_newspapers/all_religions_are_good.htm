<h2>ALL RELIGIONS ARE GOOD</h2>
<p class="center">(<i>Washington Post</i>,
October 29, 1894)</p>
<p>Mr. Kananda spoke yesterday at the People's Church on the
invitation of Dr. Kent, pastor of the church. His talk in the morning
was a regular sermon, dealing entirely with the spiritual side of
religion, and presenting the, to orthodox sects, rather original
proposition that there is good in the foundation of every religion,
that all religions, like languages, are descended from a common stock,
and that each is good in its corporal and spiritual aspects so long as
it is kept free from dogma and fossilism. The address in the afternoon
was more in the form of a lecture on the Aryan race, and traced the
descent of the various allied nationalities by their language, religion
and customs from the common Sanskrit stock. </p>
<p>After the meeting, to a <i>Post</i> reporter Mr.
Kananda said: "I claim no affiliation with any religious sect, but
occupy the position of an observer, and so far as I may, of a teacher
to mankind. All religion to me is good. About the higher mysteries of
life and existence I can do no more than speculate, as others do.
Reincarnation seems to me to be the nearest to a logical explanation
for many things with which we are confronted in the realm of religion.
But I do not advance it as a doctrine. It is no more than a theory at
best, and is not susceptible of proof except by personal experience,
and that proof is good only for the man who has it. Your experience is
nothing to me, nor<!--'Volume 2 Page 498'--> mine to you.
I am not a believer in miracles &#8212; they are repugnant to me in matters
of religion. You might bring the world tumbling down about my ears, but
that would be no proof to me that there was a God, or that you worked
by his agency, if there was one.</p>
<p class="center">HE BELIEVES IT BLINDLY</p>
<p>"I must, however, believe in a past and a hereafter as
necessary to the existence of the present. And if we go on from here,
we must go in other forms, and so comes any belief in reincarnation.
But I can prove nothing, and any one is welcome to deprive me of the
theory of reincarnation provided they will show me something better to
replace it. Only up to the present I have found nothing that offers so
satisfactory an explanation to me." </p>
<p>Mr. Kananda is a native of Calcutta, and a graduate of the
government university there. He speaks English like a native, having
received his university training in that tongue. He has had good
opportunity to observe the contact between the native and the English,
and it would disappoint a foreign missionary worker to hear him speak
in very unconcerned style of the attempts to convert the natives. In
this connection he was asked what effect the Western teaching was
having on the thought of the Orient. </p>
<p>"Of course," he said, "no thought of any sort can come into a
country without having its effect, but the effect of Christian teaching
on Oriental thought is, if it exists, so small as to be imperceptible.
The Western doctrines have made about as much impression there as have
the Eastern doctrines here, perhaps not so much. That is, among the
higher thinkers of the country. The effect of the missionary work among
the masses is imperceptible. When converts are made they of course drop
at once out of the native sects, but the mass of the population is so
great that the converts of the missionaries have very little effect
that can be seen."</p>

<p class="center">THE YOGIS ARE JUGGLERS</p>
<p>When asked whether he knew anything of the alleged miraculous
performances of the yogis and adepts Mr. Kananda replied that he was
not interested in miracles, and that while there were of course a great
many clever jugglers in the country, their performances were tricks.
Mr. Kananda said that he had seen the mango trick but once, and then by
a fakir on a small scale. He held the same view about the alleged
attainments of the lamas. "There is a great lack of trained,
scientific, and unprejudiced observers in all accounts of these
phenomena," said he, "so that it is hard to select the false from the
true."</p>
