<h2>CHILD WIDOWS OF INDIA</h2>
<p class="center">(<i>Daily Eagle</i>,
February 27, 1895)</p>
<p>Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk, lectured in Historical hall
Monday night under the auspices of the Brooklyn Ethical association, on
"India's Gift to the World". There were about two hundred and fifty
people<!--'Volume 2 Page 514'--> in the hall when the
Swami stepped on the platform. Much interest was manifested on account
of the denial by Mrs. James McKeen, president of the Brooklyn Ramabai
circle, which is interested in Christian work in India, of the
statement attributed to the lecture that the child widows of India were
not protected [ill-treated]. In no part of his lecture was reference
made to this denial, but after he had concluded, one of the audience
asked the lecturer what explanation he had to make to the statement.
Swami Vivekananda said that it was untrue that child widows were abused
or ill treated in any way. He added: </p>
<p>"It is a fact that some Hindus marry very young. Others marry
when they have attained a fair age and some do not marry at all. My
grandfather was married when quite a child. My father when he was 14
years old and I am 30 years old and am not yet married. When a husband
dies all his possessions go to his widow. If a widow is poor she is the
same as poor widows in any other country. Old men sometimes marry
children, but if the husband was wealthy it was all the better for the
widow the sooner he died. I have traveled all over India, but failed to
see a case of the ill treatment mentioned. At one time there were
religious fanatics, widows, who threw themselves into a fire and were
consumed by the flames at the death of their husbands. The Hindus did
not believe in this, but did not prevent it, and it was not until the
British obtained control of India that it was finally prohibited. These
women were considered saints and in many instances monuments were
erected to their memory."</p>
