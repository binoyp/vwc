<h2>POWERS</h2>
<p>We have now come to the chapter in which the Yoga powers are
described. </p>
<p>&#2342;&#2375;&#2358;&#2348;&#2344;&#2381;&#2343;&#2358;&#2381;&#2330;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2343;&#2366;&#2352;&#2339;&#2366; &#2405;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>1. Dhâranâ is holding the mind on to some particular object. </p>
<p>Dharana (concentration) is when the mind holds on to some
object, either in the body, or outside the body, and keeps itself in
that state. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2351;&#2376;&#2325;&#2340;&#2366;&#2344;&#2340;&#2366; &#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>2. An unbroken flow of knowledge in that object is Dhyâna. </p>
<p>The mind tries to think of one object, to hold itself to one
particular spot, as the top of the head, the heart, etc., and if the
mind succeeds in receiving the sensations only through that part of the
body, and through no other part, that would be Dharana, and when the
mind succeeds in keeping itself in that state for some time, it is
called Dhyana (mediation). </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2342;&#2375;&#2357;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2344;&#2367;&#2352;&#2381;&#2349;&#2366;&#2360;&#2306; &#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2370;&#2346;&#2358;&#2370;&#2344;&#2381;&#2351;&#2350;&#2367;&#2357; &#2360;&#2350;&#2366;&#2343;&#2367;&#2307; &#2405;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>3. When that, giving up all forms, reflects only the meaning,
it is Samâdhi. </p>
<p>That comes when in meditation the form or the external part is
given up. Suppose I were meditating on a book, and that I have
gradually succeeded in concentrating the mind on it, and perceiving
only the internal<!--'Volume 1 Page 271'--> sensations,
the meaning, unexpressed in any form &#8212; that state of Dhyana is called
Samadhi. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2351;&#2350;&#2375;&#2325;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352; &#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2307; &#2405;&#2410;&#2405;</p>
<p>4. (These) three (when practiced) in regard to one object is
Samyama. </p>
<p>When a man can direct his mind to any particular object and
fix it there, and then keep it there for a long time, separating the
object from the internal part, this is Samyama; or Dharana, Dhyana, and
Samadhi, one following the other, and making one. The form of the thing
has vanished, and only its meaning remains in the mind. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2332;&#2381;&#2332;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2365;&#2365;&#2354;&#2379;&#2325;&#2307; &#2405;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>5. By the conquest of that comes light of knowledge. </p>
<p>When one has succeeded in making this Samyama, all powers come
under his control. This is the great instrument of the Yogi. The
objects of knowledge are infinite, and they are divided into the gross,
grosser, grossest and the fine, finer, finest and so on. This Samyama
should be first applied to gross things, and when you begin to get
knowledge of this gross, slowly, by stages, it should be brought to
finer things. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2349;&#2370;&#2350;&#2367;&#2359;&#2369; &#2357;&#2367;&#2344;&#2367;&#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2307; &#2405;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>6. That should be employed in stages. </p>
<p>This is a note of warning not to attempt to go too fast. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2351;&#2350;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2352;&#2329;&#2381;&#2327;&#2306; &#2346;&#2370;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2375;&#2349;&#2381;&#2351;&#2307; &#2405;&#2413;&#2405;</p>
<p>7. These three are more internal than those that precede. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 272'-->
<p>Before these we had the Pratyâhâra, the Prânâyâma, the Âsana,
the Yama and Niyama; they are external parts of the three &#8212; Dharana,
Dhyana and Samadhi. When a man has attained to them, he may attain to
omniscience and omnipotence, but that would not be salvation. These
three would; not make the mind Nirvikalpa, changeless, but would leave
the seeds for getting bodies again. Only when the seeds are, as the
Yogi says, "fried", do they lose the possibility of producing further
plants. These powers cannot fry the seed.</p>
<p>&#2340;&#2342;&#2346;&#2367; &#2348;&#2361;&#2367;&#2352;&#2329;&#2381;&#2327;&#2306; &#2344;&#2367;&#2352;&#2381;&#2348;&#2368;&#2332;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2405;&#2414;&#2405;</p>
<p>8. But even they are external to the seedless (Samadhi). </p>
<p>Compared with that seedless Samadhi, therefore, even these are
external. We have not yet reached the real Samadhi, the highest, but a
lower stage, in which this universe still exists as we see it, and in
which are all these powers. </p>
<p>&#2357;&#2381;&#2351;&#2369;&#2340;&#2381;&#2341;&#2366;&#2344;-&#2344;&#2367;&#2352;&#2379;&#2343;&#2360;&#2306;&#2360;&#2381;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352;&#2351;&#2379;&#2352;&#2349;&#2367;&#2349;&#2357;-&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2342;&#2369;&#2352;&#2381;&#2349;&#2366;&#2357;&#2380;
&#2344;&#2367;&#2352;&#2379;&#2343;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2339;&#2330;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2357;&#2351;&#2379; &#2344;&#2367;&#2352;&#2379;&#2343;-&#2346;&#2352;&#2367;&#2339;&#2366;&#2350;&#2307; &#2405;&#2415;&#2405;</p>
<p>9. By the suppression of the disturbed impressions of the
mind, and by the rise of impressions of control, the mind, which
persists in that moment of control, is said to attain the controlling
modifications. </p>
<p>That is to say, in this first state of Samadhi the
modifications of the mind have been controlled, but not perfectly,
because if they were, there would be no modifications. If there is a
modification which impels the mind to rush out through the senses, and
the Yogi tries to control it, that very control itself will be a
modification. One wave will be checked by another wave, so it will not
be<!--'Volume 1 Page 273'--> real Samadhi in which all the
waves subside, as control itself will be a wave. Yet this lower Samadhi
is very much nearer to the higher Samadhi than when the mind comes
bubbling out. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2358;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2357;&#2366;&#2361;&#2367;&#2340;&#2366; &#2360;&#2306;&#2360;&#2381;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2405;&#2407;&#2406;&#2405;</p>
<p>10. Its flow becomes steady by habit. </p>
<p>The flow of this continuous control of the mind becomes steady
when practiced day after day, and the mind obtains the faculty of
constant concentration. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2340;&#2376;&#2325;&#2366;&#2327;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2351;&#2379;&#2307; &#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2351;&#2379;&#2342;&#2351;&#2380; &#2330;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2360;&#2350;&#2366;&#2343;&#2367;-&#2346;&#2352;&#2367;&#2339;&#2366;&#2350;&#2307; &#2405;&#2407;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>11. Taking in all sorts of objects, and concentrating upon one
object, these two powers being destroyed and manifested respectively,
the Chitta gets the modification called Samadhi. </p>
<p>The mind takes up various objects, runs into all sorts of
things. That is the lower state. There is a higher state of the mind,
when it takes up one object and excludes all others, of which Samadhi
is the result. </p>
<p>&#2358;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2379;&#2342;&#2367;&#2340;&#2380; &#2340;&#2369;&#2354;&#2381;&#2351;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2351;&#2380; &#2330;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351;&#2376;&#2325;&#2366;&#2327;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2366;-&#2346;&#2352;&#2367;&#2339;&#2366;&#2350;&#2307; &#2405;&#2407;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>12. The one-pointedness of the Chitta is when the impression
that is past and that which is present are similar. </p>
<p>How are we to know that the mind has become concentrated?
Because the idea of time will vanish. The more time passes unnoticed
the more concentrated we are. In common life we see that when we are
interested in a book we do not note the time at all, and when we leave
the book, we are often surprised to find how many hours have passed.
All time will have the tendency to<!--'Volume 1 Page 274'-->
come and stand in the one present. So the definition is given: <a name="tx1"></a>When the
past and present come and stand in one, the mind is said to be
concentrated.<a class="fnote" href="#fn1">1</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 274'-->
<p>&#2319;&#2340;&#2375;&#2344; &#2349;&#2370;&#2340;&#2375;&#2344;&#2381;&#2342;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2351;&#2375;&#2359;&#2369; &#2343;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;&#2354;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2339;&#2366;&#2357;&#2360;&#2381;&#2341;&#2366;&#2346;&#2352;&#2367;&#2339;&#2366;&#2350;&#2366; &#2357;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2326;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2366;&#2307; &#2405;&#2407;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>13. By this is explained the threefold transformation of form,
time and state, in fine or gross matter and in the organs. </p>
<p>By the threefold changes in the mind-stuff as to form, time
and state are explained the corresponding changes in gross and subtle
matter and in the organs. Suppose there is a lump of gold. It is
transformed into a bracelet and again into an ear-ring. These are
changes as to form. The same phenomena looked at from the standpoint of
time give us change as to time. Again, the bracelet or the ear-ring may
be bright or dull, thick or thin, and so on. This is change as to
state. Now referring to the aphorisms 9, l1 and 12, the mind-stuff is
changing into Vrittis &#8212; this is change as to form. That it passes
through past, present and future moments of time is change as to time.
That the impressions vary as to intensity within one particular period,
say, present, is change as to state. The concentrations taught in the
preceding aphorisms were to give the Yogi a voluntary control over the
transformations of his mind-stuff, which alone will enable him to make
the Samyama named in <a href="powers.htm#iii_4">III. 4.</a>
</p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 274'-->
<p>&#2358;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2379;&#2342;&#2367;&#2340;&#2366;&#2357;&#2381;&#2351;&#2346;&#2342;&#2375;&#2358;&#2381;&#2351;&#2343;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2369;&#2346;&#2366;&#2340;&#2379; &#2343;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;&#2368; &#2405;&#2407;&#2410;&#2405;</p>
<p>14. That which is acted upon by transformations,<!--'Volume 1 Page 275'-->
either past, present, or yet to be manifested is the qualified. </p>
<p>That is to say, the qualified is the substance which is being
acted upon by time and by the Samskâras, and getting changed and being
manifested always. </p>
<p>&#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2351;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2306; &#2346;&#2352;&#2367;&#2339;&#2366;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2351;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2375; &#2361;&#2375;&#2340;&#2369;&#2307; &#2405;&#2407;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>15. The succession of changes is the cause of manifold
evolution. </p>
<p>&#2346;&#2352;&#2367;&#2339;&#2366;&#2350;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2351;&#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2342;&#2340;&#2368;&#2340;&#2366;&#2344;&#2366;&#2327;&#2340;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2407;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>16. By making Samyama on the three sorts of changes comes the
knowledge of past and future. </p>
<p>We must not lose sight of the first definition of Samyama.
When the mind has attained to that state when it identifies itself with
the internal impression of the object, leaving the external, and when,
by long practice, that is retained by the mind and the mind can get
into that state in a moment, that is Samyama. If a man in that state
wants to know the past and future, he has to make a Samyama on the
changes in the Samskaras (III. 13). Some are working now at present,
some have worked out, and some are waiting to work. So by making a
Samyama on these he knows the past and future. </p>
<p>&#2358;&#2348;&#2381;&#2342;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2351;&#2366;&#2344;&#2366;&#2350;&#2367;&#2340;&#2352;&#2375;&#2340;&#2352;&#2366;&#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2360;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2360;&#2329;&#2381;&#2325;&#2352;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2340;&#2381;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2357;&#2367;&#2349;&#2366;&#2327;&#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;
&#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2349;&#2370;&#2340;&#2352;&#2369;&#2340;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2407;&#2413;&#2405;</p>
<p>l7. By making Samyama on word, meaning and knowledge, which
are ordinarily confused, comes the knowledge of all animal sounds. </p>
<p>The word represents the external cause, the meaning represents
the internal vibration that travels to the brain through the channels
of the Indriyas, conveying the<!--'Volume 1 Page 276'-->
external impression to the mind, and knowledge represents the reaction
of the mind, with which comes perception. These three, confused, make
our sense-objects. Suppose I hear a word; there is first the external
vibration, next the internal sensation carried to the mind by the organ
of hearing, then the mind reacts, and I know the word. The word I know
is a mixture of the three &#8212; vibration, sensation, and reaction.
Ordinarily these three are inseparable; but by practice the Yogi can
separate them. When a man has attained to this, if he makes a Samyama
on any sound, he understands the meaning which that sound was intended
to express, whether it was made by man or be any other animal. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2306;&#2360;&#2381;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352;&#2360;&#2366;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2325;&#2352;&#2339;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2346;&#2370;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2332;&#2366;&#2340;&#2367;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2407;&#2414;&#2405;</p>
<p>18. By perceiving the impressions, (comes) the knowledge of
past life. </p>
<p>Each experience that we have, comes in the form of a wave in
the Chitta, and this subsides and becomes finer and finer, but is never
lost. It remains there in minute form, and if we can bring this wave up
again, it becomes memory. So, if the Yogi can make a Samyama on these
past impressions in the mind, he will begin to remember all his past
lives. </p>
<p>&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2351;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2346;&#2352;&#2330;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2407;&#2415;&#2405;</p>
<p>19. By making Samyama on the signs in another's body,
knowledge of his mind comes. </p>
<p>Each man has particular signs on his body, which differentiate
him from others; when the Yogi makes a Samyama on these signs he knows
the nature of the mind of that person. </p>
<p>&#2344; &#2330; &#2340;&#2340;&#2381; &#2360;&#2366;&#2354;&#2350;&#2381;&#2348;&#2344;&#2306; &#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2357;&#2367;&#2359;&#2351;&#2368;&#2349;&#2370;&#2340;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2405;&#2408;&#2406;&#2405;</p>
<p>20. But not its contents, that not being the object of the
Samyama. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 277'-->
<p>He would not know the contents of the mind by making a Samyama
on the body. There would be required a twofold Samyama, first on the
signs in the body, and then on the mind itself. The Yogi would then
know everything that is in that mind. </p>
<p>&#2325;&#2366;&#2351;&#2352;&#2370;&#2346;&#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2342;&#2381;&#2327;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2361;&#2381;&#2351;&#2358;&#2325;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;-&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2350;&#2381;&#2349;&#2375;
&#2330;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2369;&#2307;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2325;&#2366;&#2358;&#2366;&#2360;&#2306;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2375;&#2365;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2352;&#2381;&#2343;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2408;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>21. By making Samyama on the form of the body, the
perceptibility of the form being obstructed and the power of
manifestation in the eye being separated, the Yogi's body becomes
unseen. </p>
<p>A Yogi standing in the midst of this room can apparently
vanish. He does not really vanish, but he will not be seen by anyone.
The form and the body are, as it were, separated. You must remember
that this can only be done when the Yogi has attained to that power of
concentration when form and the thing formed have been separated. Then
he makes a Samyama on that, and the power to perceive forms is
obstructed, because the power of perceiving forms comes from the
junction of form and the thing formed. </p>
<p>&#2319;&#2340;&#2375;&#2344; &#2358;&#2348;&#2381;&#2342;&#2366;&#2342;&#2381;&#2351;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2352;&#2381;&#2343;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2369;&#2325;&#2381;&#2340;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2408;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>22. By this the disappearance or concealment of words which
are being spoken and such other things are also explained. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2379;&#2346;&#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2350;&#2306; &#2344;&#2367;&#2352;&#2369;&#2346;&#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2350;&#2306; &#2330; &#2325;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350; &#2340;&#2340;&#2381;&#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2342;&#2346;&#2352;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2352;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2375;&#2349;&#2381;&#2351;&#2379; &#2357;&#2366;
&#2405;&#2408;&#2409; &#2405;</p>
<p>23. Karma is of two kinds &#8212; soon to be fructified and late to
be fructified. By making Samyana<!--'Volume 1 Page 278'-->
on these, or by the signs called Arishta, portents, the Yogis know the
exact time of separation from their bodies. </p>
<p>When a Yogi makes a Samyama on his own Karma, upon those
impressions in his mind which are now working, and those which are just
waiting to work, he knows exactly by those that are waiting when his
body will fall. He knows when he will die, at what hour, even at what
minute. The Hindus think very much of that knowledge or consciousness
of the nearness of death, because it is taught in the Gita that the
thoughts at the moment of departure are great powers in determining the
next life. </p>
<p>&#2350;&#2376;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2342;&#2367;&#2359;&#2369; &#2348;&#2354;&#2366;&#2344;&#2367; &#2405;&#2408;&#2410;</p>
<p>24. By making Samyama on friendship, mercy, etc. (<a href="concentration_its_spiritual_uses.htm#i_33">I. 33</a>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 278'-->), the Yogi excels in the
respective qualities. </p>
<p>&#2348;&#2354;&#2375;&#2359;&#2369; &#2361;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;&#2348;&#2354;&#2366;&#2342;&#2368;&#2344;&#2367; &#2405;&#2408;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>25. By making Samyama on the strength of the elephant and
others, their respective strength comes to the Yogi. </p>
<p>When a Yogi has attained to this Samyama and wants strength,
he makes a Samyama on the strength of the elephant and gets it.
Infinite energy is at the disposal of everyone if he only knows how to
get it. The Yogi has discovered the science of getting it. </p>
<p>&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2357;&#2371;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2354;&#2379;&#2325;&#2344;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2360;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2360;&#2370;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2381;&#2350;-&#2357;&#2381;&#2351;&#2357;&#2361;&#2367;&#2340;-&#2357;&#2367;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2325;&#2371;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2408;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>26. By making Samyama on the Effulgent Light (<a href="concentration_its_spiritual_uses.htm#i_36">I. 36</a>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 278'-->), comes the knowledge of the
fine, the obstructed, and the remote. </p>
<p>When the Yogi makes Samyama on that Effulgent<!--'Volume 1 Page 279'-->
Light in the heart, he sees things which are very remote, things, for
instance, that are happening in a distant place, and which are
obstructed by mountain barriers, and also things which are very fine. </p>
<p>&#2349;&#2369;&#2357;&#2344;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2306; &#2360;&#2370;&#2352;&#2381;&#2351;&#2375; &#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2405;&#2408;&#2413;&#2405;</p>
<p>27. By making Samyama on the sun, (comes) the knowledge of the
world. </p>
<p>&#2330;&#2344;&#2381;&#2342;&#2381;&#2352;&#2375; &#2340;&#2366;&#2352;&#2366;&#2357;&#2381;&#2351;&#2370;&#2361;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2408;&#2414;&#2405;</p>
<p>28. On the moon, (comes) the knowledge of the cluster of
stars. </p>
<p>&#2343;&#2381;&#2352;&#2369;&#2357;&#2375; &#2340;&#2342;&#2381;&#2327;&#2340;&#2367;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2408;&#2415;&#2405;</p>
<p>29. On the pole-star, (comes) the knowledge of the motions of
the stars. </p>
<p>&#2344;&#2366;&#2349;&#2367;&#2330;&#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2375; &#2325;&#2366;&#2351;&#2357;&#2381;&#2351;&#2370;&#2361;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2406;&#2405;</p>
<p>30. On the navel circle, (comes) the knowledge of the
constitution of the body. </p>
<p>&#2325;&#2339;&#2381;&#2336;&#2325;&#2370;&#2346;&#2375; &#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2369;&#2340;&#2381;&#2346;&#2367;&#2346;&#2366;&#2360;&#2366;&#2344;&#2367;&#2357;&#2371;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;&#2307; &#2405;&#2409;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>31. On the hollow of the throat, (comes) cessation of hunger. </p>
<p>When a man is very hungry, if he can make Samyama on the
hollow of the throat, hunger ceases. </p>
<p>&#2325;&#2370;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;&#2344;&#2366;&#2337;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2306; &#2360;&#2381;&#2341;&#2376;&#2352;&#2381;&#2351;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>32. On the nerve called Kurma, (comes) fixity of the body. </p>
<p>When he is practising, the body is not disturbed. </p>
<p>&#2350;&#2370;&#2352;&#2381;&#2343;&#2332;&#2381;&#2351;&#2379;&#2340;&#2367;&#2359;&#2367; &#2360;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2342;&#2352;&#2381;&#2358;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>33. On the light emanating from the top of the head, sight of
the Siddhas. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 280'-->
<p> The Siddhas are beings who are a little above ghosts. When
the Yogi concentrates his mind on the top of his head, he will see
these Siddhas. The word Siddha does not refer to those men who have
become free &#8212; a sense in which it is often used. </p>
<p>&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2340;&#2367;&#2349;&#2366;&#2342;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366; &#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2410;&#2405;</p>
<p>34. Or by the power of Prâtibha, all knowledge. </p>
<p>All these can come without any Samyama to the man who has the
power of Pratibha (spontaneous enlightenment from purity). When a man
has risen to a high state of Pratibha, he has that great light. All
things are apparent to him. Everything comes to him naturally without
making Samyama. </p>
<p>&#2361;&#2381;&#2352;&#2342;&#2351;&#2375; &#2330;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;-&#2360;&#2306;&#2357;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>35. In the heart, knowledge of minds. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2346;&#2369;&#2352;&#2369;&#2359;&#2351;&#2379;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2366;&#2360;&#2306;&#2325;&#2368;&#2352;&#2381;&#2339;&#2351;&#2379;&#2307; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2351;&#2366;&#2357;&#2367;&#2358;&#2375;&#2359;&#2366;&#2342;&#2381; &#2349;&#2379;&#2327;&#2307;
&#2346;&#2352;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2346;&#2369;&#2352;&#2369;&#2359;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>36. Enjoyment comes from the non-discrimination of the soul
and Sattva which are totally different because the latter's actions are
for another. Samyama on the self-centred one gives knowledge of the
Purusha. </p>
<p>All action of Sattva, a modification of Prakriti characterised
by light and happiness, is for the soul. When Sattva is free from
egoism and illuminated with the pure intelligence of Purusha, it is
called the self-centred one, because in that state it becomes
independent of all relations. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2340;&#2307; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2340;&#2367;&#2349;&#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2357;&#2339;&#2357;&#2375;&#2342;&#2344;&#2366;&#2342;&#2352;&#2381;&#2358;&#2366;&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2342;&#2357;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2340;&#2366; &#2332;&#2366;&#2351;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2375; &#2405;&#2409;&#2413;&#2405;</p>
<p>37. From that arises the knowledge belonging<!--'Volume 1 Page 281'-->
to Pratibha and (supernatural) hearing, touching, seeing, tasting and
smelling. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2375; &#2360;&#2350;&#2366;&#2343;&#2366;&#2357;&#2369;&#2346;&#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2327;&#2366; &#2357;&#2381;&#2351;&#2369;&#2340;&#2381;&#2341;&#2366;&#2344;&#2375; &#2360;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2351;&#2307; &#2405;&#2409;&#2414;&#2405;</p>
<p>38. These are obstacles to Samadhi; but they are powers in the
worldly state. </p>
<p>To the Yogi knowledge of the enjoyments of the world comes by
the junction of the Purusha and the mind. If he wants to make Samyama
on the knowledge that they are two different things, nature and soul,
he gets knowledge of the Purusha. From that arises discrimination. When
he has got that discrimination, he gets the Pratibha, the light of
supreme genius. These powers, however, are obstructions to the
attainment of the highest goal, the knowledge of the pure Self, and
freedom. These are, as it were, to be met in the way; and if the Yogi
rejects them, he attains the highest. If he is tempted to acquire
these, his further progress is barred.</p>
<p>&#2348;&#2344;&#2381;&#2343;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352;&#2339;&#2358;&#2376;&#2341;&#2367;&#2354;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2330;&#2366;&#2352;&#2360;&#2306;&#2357;&#2375;&#2342;&#2344;&#2366;&#2330;&#2381;&#2330; &#2330;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2346;&#2352;&#2358;&#2352;&#2368;&#2352;&#2366;&#2357;&#2375;&#2358;&#2307; &#2405;&#2409;&#2415; &#2405;</p>
<p>39. When the cause of bondage of the Chitta has become
loosened, the Yogi, by his knowledge of its channels of activity (the
nerves), enters another's body. </p>
<p>The Yogi can enter a dead body and make it get up and move,
even while he himself is working in another body. Or he can enter a
living body and hold that man's mind and organs in check, and for the
time being act through the body of that man. That is done by the Yogi
coming to this discrimination of Purusha and nature. If he wants to
enter another's body, he makes a Samyama on that body and enters it,
because, not only is his soul omnipresent, but his mind also, as the
Yogi teaches. It is<!--'Volume 1 Page 282'--> one bit of
the universal mind. Now, however, it can only work; through the nerve
currents in this body, but when the Yogi has loosened himself from
these nerve currents, he can work through other things. </p>
<p>&#2313;&#2342;&#2366;&#2344;&#2332;&#2351;&#2366;&#2332;&#2381;&#2332;&#2354;&#2346;&#2329;&#2381;&#2325;&#2325;&#2339;&#2381;&#2335;&#2325;&#2366;&#2342;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2357;&#2360;&#2329;&#2381;&#2327; &#2313;&#2340;&#2381;&#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;&#2358;&#2381;&#2330; &#2405;&#2410;&#2406;&#2405;</p>
<p>40. By conquering the current called Udâna the Yogi does not
sink in water or in swamps, he can walk on thorns etc., and can, die at
will. </p>
<p>Udana is the name of the nerve current that governs the lungs
and all the upper parts of the body, and when he is master of it, he
becomes light in weight. He does not sink in water; he can walk on
thorns and sword blades, and stand in fire, and can depart this life
whenever he likes. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2332;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2332;&#2381;&#2357;&#2354;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2410;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>41. By the conquest of the current Samâna he is surrounded by
a blaze of light. </p>
<p>Whenever he likes, light flashes from his body. </p>
<p>&#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2379;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2325;&#2366;&#2358;&#2351;&#2379;&#2307; &#2360;&#2350;&#2381;&#2348;&#2344;&#2381;&#2343;&#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2342;&#2381;&#2342;&#2367;&#2357;&#2381;&#2351;&#2306; &#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2379;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2410;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>42. By making Samyama on the relation between the ear and the
Akâsha comes divine hearing. </p>
<p>There is the Akasha, the ether, and the instrument, the ear.
By making Samyama on them the Yogi gets supernormal hearing; he hears
everything. Anything spoken or sounded miles away he can hear. </p>
<p>&#2325;&#2366;&#2351;&#2366;&#2325;&#2366;&#2358;&#2351;&#2379;&#2307; &#2360;&#2350;&#2381;&#2348;&#2344;&#2381;&#2343;&#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2354;&#2381;&#2354;&#2328;&#2369;&#2340;&#2370;&#2354;&#2360;&#2350;&#2366;&#2346;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2375;&#2358;&#2381;&#2330;&#2366;&#2325;&#2366;&#2358;&#2327;&#2350;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2410;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>43. By making Samyama on the relation between the Akasha and
the body and becoming light<!--'Volume 1 Page 283'--> as
cotton-wool etc., through meditation on them, the yogi goes through the
skies. </p>
<p>This Akasha is the material of this body; it is only Akasha in
a certain form that has become the body. If the Yogi makes a Sanyama on
this Akasha material of his body, it acquires the lightness of Akasha,
and he can go anywhere through the air. So in the other case also. </p>
<p>&#2348;&#2361;&#2367;&#2352;&#2325;&#2354;&#2381;&#2346;&#2367;&#2340;&#2366; &#2357;&#2371;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;&#2361;&#2366;&#2357;&#2367;&#2342;&#2375;&#2361;&#2366; &#2340;&#2340;&#2307; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2325;&#2366;&#2358;&#2366;&#2357;&#2352;&#2339;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2351;&#2307; &#2405;&#2410;&#2410;&#2405;</p>
<p>44. By making Samyama on the "real modifications" of the mind,
outside of the body, called great disembodiedness, comes disappearance
of the covering to light. </p>
<p>The mind in its foolishness thinks that it is working in this
body. Why should I be bound by one system of nerves, and put the Ego
only in one body, if the mind is omnipresent? There is no reason why I
should. The Yogi wants to feel the Ego wherever he likes. The mental
waves which arise in the absence of egoism in the body are called "real
modifications" or "great disembodiedness". When he has succeeded in
making Samyama on these modifications, all covering to light goes away,
and all darkness and ignorance vanish. Everything appears to him to be
full of knowledge. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2381;&#2341;&#2370;&#2354;-&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2370;&#2346;-&#2360;&#2370;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2357;&#2351;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2357;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2342;&#2381;&#2349;&#2370;&#2340;&#2332;&#2351;&#2307; &#2405;&#2410;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>45. By making Samyama on the gross and fine forms of the
elements, their essential traits, the inherence of the Gunas in them
and on their contributing to the experience of the soul, comes mastery
of the elements. </p>
<p>The Yogi makes Samyama on the elements, first on the gross,
and then on the finer states. This Samyama<!--'Volume 1 Page 284'-->
is taken up more by a sect of the Buddhists. They take a lump of clay
and make Samyama on that, and gradually they begin to see the fine
materials of which it is composed, and when they have known all the
fine materials in it, they get power over that element. So with all the
elements. The Yogi can conquer them all. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2340;&#2379;&#2365;&#2339;&#2367;&#2350;&#2366;&#2342;&#2367;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2342;&#2369;&#2352;&#2381;&#2349;&#2366;&#2357;&#2307; &#2325;&#2366;&#2351;&#2360;&#2350;&#2381;&#2346;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2349;&#2367;&#2328;&#2366;&#2340;&#2358;&#2381;&#2330; &#2405;&#2410;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>46. From that comes minuteness and the rest of the powers,
"glorification of the body," and indestructibleness of the bodily
qualities. </p>
<p>This means that the Yogi has attained the eight powers. He can
make himself as minute as a particle, or as huge as a mountain, as
heavy as the earth, or as light as the air; he can reach anything he
likes, he can rule everything he wants, he can conquer everything he
wants, and so on. A lion will sit at his feet like a lamb, and all his
desires will be fulfilled at will. </p>
<p>&#2352;&#2370;&#2346;-&#2354;&#2366;&#2357;&#2339;&#2381;&#2351;-&#2348;&#2354;-&#2357;&#2332;&#2381;&#2352;&#2360;&#2306;&#2361;&#2344;&#2344;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2344;&#2367; &#2325;&#2366;&#2351;&#2360;&#2350;&#2381;&#2346;&#2340;&#2381; &#2405;&#2410;&#2413;&#2405;</p>
<p>47. The "glorification of the body" is beauty, complexion,
strength, adamantine hardness. </p>
<p>The body becomes indestructible. Nothing can injure it.
Nothing can destroy it until the Yogi wishes. "Breaking the rod of time
he lives in this universe with his body." In the Vedas it is written
that for that man there is no more disease, death or pain. </p>
<p>&#2327;&#2381;&#2352;&#2361;&#2339;-&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2370;&#2346;&#2366;&#2360;&#2381;&#2350;&#2367;&#2340;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2357;&#2351;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2357;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2342;&#2367;&#2344;&#2381;&#2342;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2351;&#2332;&#2351;&#2307; &#2405;&#2410;&#2414;&#2405;</p>
<p>48. By making Samyama on the objectivity and power of
illumination of the organs, on egoism, the inherence of the Gunas in
them and on their contributing to the experience of the soul, comes the
conquest of the organs. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 285'-->
<p>In the perception of external objects the organs leave their
place in the mind and go towards the object; this is followed by
knowledge. Egoism also is present in the act. When the Yogi makes
Samyama on these and the other two by gradation, he conquers the
organs. Take up anything that you see or feel, a book for instance;
first concentrate the mind on it, then on the knowledge that is in the
form of a book, and then on the Ego that sees the book, and so on. By
that practice all the organs will be conquered. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2340;&#2379; &#2350;&#2344;&#2379;&#2332;&#2357;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2306; &#2357;&#2367;&#2325;&#2352;&#2339;&#2349;&#2366;&#2357;&#2307; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2343;&#2366;&#2344;&#2332;&#2351;&#2358;&#2381;&#2330; &#2405;&#2410;&#2415;&#2405;</p>
<p>49. From that comes to the body the power of rapid movement
like the mind, power of the organs independently of the body, and
conquest of nature. </p>
<p>Just as by the conquest of the elements comes glorified body,
so from the conquest of the organs will come the above-mentioned
powers. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2346;&#2369;&#2352;&#2369;&#2359;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2351;&#2340;&#2366;&#2326;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2367;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2349;&#2366;&#2357;&#2366;&#2343;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2336;&#2366;&#2340;&#2371;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2306;
&#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2340;&#2371;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2334;&#2381;&#2330; &#2405;&#2411;&#2406;&#2405;</p>
<p>50. By making Samyama on the discrimination between the Sattva
and the Purusha come omnipotence and omniscience. </p>
<p>When nature has been conquered, and the difference between the
Purusha and nature realised &#8212; that the Purusha is indestructible, pure
and perfect &#8212; then come omnipotence and omniscience. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2342;&#2381;&#2357;&#2376;&#2352;&#2366;&#2327;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2342;&#2346;&#2367; &#2342;&#2379;&#2359;&#2348;&#2368;&#2332;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2351;&#2375; &#2325;&#2376;&#2357;&#2354;&#2381;&#2351;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2411;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>51. By giving up even these powers comes the destruction of
the very seed of evil, which leads to Kaivalya. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 286'-->
<p>He attains aloneness, independence, and becomes free. When one
gives up even the ideas of omnipotence and omniscience, there comes
entire rejection of enjoyment, of the temptations from celestial
beings. When the Yogi has seen all these wonderful powers, and rejected
them, he reaches the goal. What are all these powers? Simply
manifestations. They are no better than dreams. Even omnipotence is a
dream. It depends on the mind. So long as there is a mind it can be
understood, but the goal is beyond even the mind. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2381;&#2341;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2351;&#2369;&#2346;&#2344;&#2367;&#2350;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2339;&#2375; &#2360;&#2329;&#2381;&#2327;&#2360;&#2381;&#2350;&#2351;&#2366;&#2325;&#2352;&#2339;&#2306; &#2346;&#2369;&#2344;&#2352;&#2344;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2360;&#2329;&#2381;&#2327;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2405;&#2411;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>52. The Yogi should not feel allured or flattered by the
overtures of celestial beings for fear of evil again. </p>
<p>There are other dangers too; gods and other beings come to
tempt the Yogi. They do not want anyone to be perfectly free. They are
jealous, just as we are, and worse than us sometimes. They are very
much afraid of losing their places. Those Yogis who do not reach
perfection die and become gods; leaving the direct road they go into
one of the side streets, and get these powers. Then, again, they have
to be born. But he who is strong enough to withstand these temptations
and go straight to the goal, becomes free. </p>
<p>&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2339;-&#2340;&#2340;&#2381;&#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2350;&#2351;&#2379;&#2307; &#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2342;&#2381;&#2357;&#2367;&#2357;&#2375;&#2325;&#2332;&#2306; &#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2411;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>53. By making Samyama on a particle of time and its precession
and succession comes discrimination. </p>
<p>How are we to avoid all these things, these Devas, and
heavens, and powers? By discrimination, by knowing good from evil.
Therefore a Samyama is given by which the power of discrimination can
be strengthened.<!--'Volume 1 Page 287'--> This by making
a Samyama on a particle of time, and the time preceding and following
it. </p>
<p>&#2332;&#2366;&#2340;&#2367;-&#2354;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2339;-&#2342;&#2375;&#2358;&#2376;&#2352;&#2344;&#2381;&#2351;&#2340;&#2366;&#2365;&#2344;&#2357;&#2330;&#2381;&#2331;&#2375;&#2342;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2369;&#2354;&#2381;&#2351;&#2351;&#2379;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2340;&#2307; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2367;&#2346;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;&#2307; &#2405;&#2411;&#2410;&#2405;</p>
<p>54. Those things which cannot be differentiated by species,
sign, and place, even they will be discriminated by the above Samyama. </p>
<p>The misery that we suffer comes from ignorance, from
non-discrimination between the real and the unreal. We all take the bad
for the good, the dream for the reality. Soul is the only reality, and
we have forgotten it. Body is an unreal dream, and we think we are all
bodies. This non-discrimination is the cause of misery. It is caused by
ignorance. When discrimination comes, it brings strength, and then
alone can we avoid all these various ideas of body, heavens, and gods.
This ignorance arises through differentiating by species, sign, and
place. For instance, take a cow. The cow is differentiated from the dog
by species. Even with the cows alone how do we make the distinction
between one cow and another? By signs. If two objects are exactly
similar, they can be distinguished if they are in different places.
When objects are so mixed up that even these differential will not help
us, the power of discrimination acquired by the above-mentioned
practice will give us the ability to distinguish them. The highest
philosophy of the Yogi is based upon this fact, that the Purusha is
pure and perfect, and is the only "simple" that exists in this
universe. The body and mind are compounds, and yet we are ever
identifying ourselves with them This is the great mistake that the
distinction has been lost. When this power of discrimination has been
attained, man sees that everything in this world, mental and physical,
is a compound, and, as such, cannot be the Purusha. </p>

<p>&#2340;&#2366;&#2352;&#2325;&#2306; &#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2357;&#2367;&#2359;&#2351;&#2306; &#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2341;&#2366;&#2357;&#2367;&#2359;&#2351;&#2350;&#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2350;&#2334;&#2381;&#2330;&#2375;&#2340;&#2367; &#2357;&#2367;&#2357;&#2375;&#2325;&#2332;&#2306; &#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2411;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>55. The saving knowledge is that knowledge of discrimination
which simultaneously covers all objects, in all their variations. </p>
<p>Saving, because the knowledge takes the Yogi across the ocean
of birth and death. The whole of Prakriti in all its states, subtle and
gross, is within the grasp of this knowledge. There is no succession in
perception by this knowledge; it takes in all things simultaneously, at
a glance. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2346;&#2369;&#2352;&#2369;&#2359;&#2351;&#2379;&#2307; &#2358;&#2369;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2367;&#2360;&#2366;&#2350;&#2381;&#2351;&#2375; &#2325;&#2376;&#2357;&#2354;&#2381;&#2351;&#2350;&#2367;&#2340;&#2367; &#2405;&#2411;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>56. By the similarity of purity between the Sattva and the
Purusha comes Kaivalya. </p>
<p>When the soul realises that it depends on nothing in the
universe, from gods to the lowest atom, that is called Kaivalya
(isolation) and perfection. It is attained when this mixture of purity
and impurity called Sattva (intellect) has been made as pure as the
Purusha itself; then the Sattva reflects only the unqualified essence
of purity, which is the Purusha.</p>

are completely suppressed by the latter which stand in bold relief,
