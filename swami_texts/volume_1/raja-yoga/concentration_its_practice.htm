<p>&#2340;&#2346;&#2307; &#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2351;&#2375;&#2358;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2339;&#2367;&#2343;&#2366;&#2344;&#2366;&#2344;&#2367; &#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2351;&#2366;&#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2307; &#2405;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>1. Mortification, study, and surrendering fruits of work to
God are called Kriyâ-yoga. </p>
<p>Those Samâdhis with which we ended our last chapter are very
difficult to attain; so we must take them up slowly. The first step,
the preliminary step, is called Kriya-yoga. Literally this means work,
working towards Yoga. The organs are the horses, the mind is the rein,
the intellect is the charioteer, the soul is the rider, and the body is
the chariot. The master of the household, the King, the Self of man, is
sitting in this chariot. If the horses are very strong and do not obey
the rein, if the charioteer, the intellect, does not know how to
control the horses, then the chariot will come to grief. But if the
organs, the horses, are well controlled, and if the rein, the mind, is
well held in the hands of the charioteer, the intellect, the chariot
reaches the goal. What is meant, therefore, by this mortification?
Holding the rein firmly while guiding the body and the organs; not
letting them do anything they like, but keeping them both under proper
control. <i>Study</i>. What is meant by study in this
case? No study of novels or story books, but study of those works which
teach the liberation of the Soul. Then again this study does not mean
controversial studies at all. The Yogi is supposed to have finished his
period of controversy. He has had enough of that, and has become
satisfied. He only studies to intensify his convictions. Vâda and
Siddhânta &#8212; these are the two sorts of scriptural knowledge &#8212; Vada (the
argumentative) and Siddhanta (the decisive). When a man is entirely
ignorant he takes up the first of these, the<!--'Volume 1 Page 236'-->
argumentative fighting, and reasoning pro and con; and when he has
finished that he takes up the Siddhanta, the decisive, arriving at a
conclusion. Simply arriving at this conclusion will not do. It must be
intensified. Books are infinite in number, and time is short; therefore
the secret of knowledge is to take what is essential. Take that and try
to live up to it. There is an old Indian legend that if you place a cup
of milk and water before a Râja-Hamsa (swan), he will take all the milk
and leave the water. In that way we should take what is of value in
knowledge, and leave the dross. Intellectual gymnastics are necessary
at first. We must not go blindly into anything. The Yogi has passed the
argumentative state, and has come to a conclusion, which is, like the
rocks, immovable. The only thing he now seeks to do is to intensify
that conclusion. Do not argue, he says; if one forces arguments upon
you, be silent. Do not answer any argument, but go away calmly, because
arguments only disturb the mind. The only thing necessary is to train
the intellect, what is the use of disturbing it for nothing? The
intellect is but a weak instrument, and can give us only knowledge
limited by the senses. The Yogi wants to go beyond the senses,
therefore intellect is of no use to him. He is certain of this and,
therefore, is silent, and does not argue. Every argument throws his
mind out of balance, creates a disturbance in the Chitta, and a
disturbance is a drawback. Argumentations and searchings of the reason
are only by the way. There are much higher things beyond them. The
whole of life is not for schoolboy fights and debating societies.
"Surrendering the fruits of work to God" is to take to ourselves
neither credit nor blame, but to give up both to the Lord and be at
peace. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2350;&#2366;&#2343;&#2367;-&#2349;&#2366;&#2357;&#2344;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2307; &#2325;&#2381;&#2354;&#2375;&#2358;-&#2340;&#2344;&#2370;&#2325;&#2352;&#2339;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2358;&#2381;&#2330; &#2405;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>2. (It is for) the practice of Samadhi and minimising the
pain-bearing obstructions. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 237'-->
<p>Most of us make our minds like spoilt children, allowing them
to do whatever they want. Therefore it is necessary that Kriya-yoga
should be constantly practised, in order to gain control of the mind,
and bring it into subjection. The obstructions to Yoga arise from lack
of control, and cause us pain. They can only be removed by denying the
mind, and holding it in check, through the means of Kriya-yoga. </p>
<p>&#2309;&#2357;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2360;&#2381;&#2350;&#2367;&#2340;&#2366;-&#2352;&#2366;&#2327;-&#2342;&#2381;&#2357;&#2375;&#2359;&#2366;&#2349;&#2367;&#2344;&#2367;&#2357;&#2375;&#2358;&#2366;&#2307; &#2325;&#2381;&#2354;&#2375;&#2358;&#2366;&#2307; &#2405;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>3. The pain-bearing obstructions are &#8212; ignorance, egoism,
attachment, aversion and clinging to life. </p>
<p>These are the five pains, the fivefold tie that binds us down,
of which ignorance is the cause and the other four its effects. It is
the only cause of all our misery. What else can make us miserable? The
nature of the Soul is eternal bliss. What can make it sorrowful except
ignorance, hallucination, delusion? All pain of the Soul is simply
delusion. </p>
<p>&#2309;&#2357;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2375;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2350;&#2369;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2352;&#2375;&#2359;&#2366;&#2306; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2360;&#2369;&#2346;&#2381;&#2340;-&#2340;&#2344;&#2369;-&#2357;&#2367;&#2330;&#2381;&#2331;&#2367;&#2344;&#2381;&#2344;&#2379;&#2342;&#2366;&#2352;&#2366;&#2339;&#2366;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2410;&#2405;</p>
<p>4. Ignorance is the productive field of all these that follow,
whether they are dormant, attenuated, overpowered, or expanded. </p>
<p>Ignorance is the cause of egoism, attachment, aversion, and
clinging to life. These impressions exist in different states. They are
sometimes dormant. You often hear the expression "innocent as a baby,"
yet in the baby may be the state of a demon or of a god, which will
come out by degrees. In the Yogi, these impressions, the Samskâras left
by past actions, are attenuated, that is, exist in a very fine state,
and he can control them, and not allow them to become manifest.
"Overpowered" means that sometimes<!--'Volume 1 Page 238'-->
one set of impressions is held down for a while by those that are
stronger, but they come out when that repressing cause is removed. The
last state is the "expanded," when the Samskaras, having helpful
surroundings, attain to a great activity, either as good or evil. </p>
<p>&#2309;&#2344;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2358;&#2369;&#2330;&#2367;-&#2342;&#2369;&#2307;&#2326;&#2366;&#2344;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2360;&#2369; &#2344;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;-&#2358;&#2369;&#2330;&#2367;-&#2360;&#2369;&#2326;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2326;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2367;&#2352;&#2357;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366; &#2405;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>5. Ignorance is taking the non-eternal, the impure, the
painful, and the non-Self for the eternal, the pure, the happy, and the
Âtman or Self (respectively). </p>
<p>All the different sorts of impressions have one source,
ignorance. We have first to learn what ignorance is. All of us think,
"I am the body, and not the Self, the pure, the effulgent, the ever
blissful," and that is ignorance. We think of man, and see man as body.
This is the great delusion. </p>
<p>&#2342;&#2371;&#2327;&#2381;&#2342;&#2352;&#2381;&#2358;&#2344;&#2358;&#2325;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2379;&#2352;&#2375;&#2325;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2340;&#2375;&#2357;&#2366;&#2360;&#2381;&#2350;&#2367;&#2340;&#2366; &#2405;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>6. Egoism is the identification of the seer with the
instrument of seeing. </p>
<p>The seer is really the Self, the pure one, the ever holy, the
infinite, the immortal. This is the Self of man. And what are the
instruments? The Chitta or mind-stuff, the Buddhi or determinative
faculty, the Manas or mind, and the Indriyas or sense-organs. These are
the instruments for him to see the external world, and the
identification of the Self with the instruments is what is called the
ignorance of egoism. We say, "I am the mind," "I am thought," "I am
angry," or "I am happy". How can we be angry and how can we hate? We
should identify ourselves with the Self that cannot change. If It is
unchangeable, how can It be one moment happy, and one moment unhappy?
It is formless, infinite, omnipresent. What can change It ? It is
beyond all law. What can affect it? Nothing in the<!--'Volume 1 Page 239'-->
universe can produce an effect on It. Yet through ignorance, we
identify ourselves with the mind-stuff, and think we feel pleasure or
pain. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2369;&#2326;&#2366;&#2344;&#2369;&#2358;&#2351;&#2368; &#2352;&#2366;&#2327;&#2307; &#2405;&#2413;&#2405;</p>
<p>7. Attachment is that which dwells on pleasure. </p>
<p>We find pleasure in certain things, and the mind like a
current flows towards them; and this following the pleasure centre, as
it were, is what is called attachment. We are never attached where we
do not find pleasure. We find pleasure in very queer things sometimes,
but the principle remains: wherever we find pleasure, there we are
attached. </p>
<p>&#2342;&#2369;&#2307;&#2326;&#2366;&#2344;&#2369;&#2358;&#2351;&#2368; &#2342;&#2381;&#2357;&#2375;&#2359;&#2307; &#2405;&#2414;&#2405;</p>
<p>8. Aversion is that which dwells on pain. </p>
<p>That which gives us pain we immediately seek to get away from.
</p>
<p>&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2360;&#2357;&#2366;&#2361;&#2368; &#2357;&#2367;&#2342;&#2369;&#2359;&#2379;&#2365;&#2346;&#2367; &#2340;&#2341;&#2366;&#2352;&#2370;&#2338;&#2379;&#2365;&#2349;&#2367;&#2344;&#2367;&#2357;&#2375;&#2358;&#2307; &#2405;&#2415;&#2405;</p>
<p>9. Flowing through its own nature, and established even in the
learned, is the clinging to life. </p>
<p>This clinging to life you see manifested in every animal. Upon
it many attempts have been made to build the theory of a future life,
because men are so fond of life that they desire a future life also. Of
course it goes without saying that this argument is without much value,
but the most curious part of it is, that, in Western countries, the
idea that this clinging to life indicates a possibility of future life
applies only to men, but does not include animals. In India this
clinging to life has been one of the arguments to prove past experience
and existence. For instance, if it be true that all our knowledge has
come from<!--'Volume 1 Page 240'--> experience, then it is
sure that that which we never experienced we cannot imagine or
understand. As soon as chickens are hatched they begin to pick up food.
Many times it has been seen, where ducks have been hatched by hens,
that, as soon as they came out of the eggs they flew to water, and the
mother thought they would be drowned. If experience be the only source
of knowledge, where did these chickens learn to pick up food, or the
ducklings that the water was their natural element? If you say it is
instinct, it means nothing &#8212; it is simply giving a word, but is no
explanation. What is this instinct? We have many instincts in
ourselves. For instance, most of you ladies play the piano, and
remember, when you first learned, how carefully you had to put your
fingers on the black and the white keys, one after the other, but now,
after long years of practice, you can talk with your friends while your
fingers play mechanically. It has become instinct. So with every work
we do; by practice it becomes instinct, it becomes automatic; but so
far as we know, all the cases which we now regard as automatic are
degenerated reason. In the language of the Yogi, instinct is involved
reason. Discrimination becomes involved, and gets to be automatic
Samskaras. Therefore it is perfectly logical to think that all we call
instinct in this world is simply involved reason. As reason cannot come
without experience, all instinct is, therefore, the result of past
experience. Chickens fear the hawk, and ducklings love the water; these
are both the results of past experience. Then the question is whether
that experience belongs to a particular soul, or to the body simply,
whether this experience which comes to the duck is the duck's
forefathers' experience, or the duck's own experience. Modern
scientific men hold that it belongs to the body, but the Yogis hold
that it is the experience of the mind, transmitted through the body.
This is called the theory of reincarnation. </p>
<p>We have seen that all our knowledge, whether we call<!--'Volume 1 Page 241'-->
it perception, or reason, or instinct, must come through that one
channel called experience, and all that we now call instinct is the
result of past experience, degenerated into instinct and that instinct
regenerates into reason again. So on throughout the universe, and upon
this has been built one of the chief arguments for reincarnation in
India. The recurring experiences of various fears, in course of time,
produce this clinging to life. That is why the child is instinctively
afraid, because the past experience of pain is there in it. Even in the
most learned men, who know that this body will go, and who say "never
mind, we have had hundreds of bodies, the soul cannot die" &#8212; even in
them, with all their intellectual convictions, we still find this
clinging on to life. Why is this clinging to life? We have seen that it
has become instinctive. In the psychological language of the Yogis it
has become a Samskara. The Samskaras, fine and hidden, are sleeping in
the Chitta. All this past experience of death, all that which we call
instinct, is experience become subconscious. It lives in the Chitta,
and is not inactive, but is working underneath. </p>
<p>The Chitta-Vrittis, the mind-waves, which are gross, we can
appreciate and feel; they can be more easily controlled, but what about
the finer instincts? How can they be controlled? When I am angry, my
whole mind becomes a huge wave of anger. I feel it, see it, handle it,
can easily manipulate it, can fight with it; but I shall not succeed
perfectly in the fight until I can get down below to its causes. A man
says something very harsh to me, and I begin to feel that I am getting
heated, and he goes on till I am perfectly angry and forget myself,
identify myself with anger. When he first began to abuse me, I thought,
"I am going to be angry". Anger was one thing, and I was another; but
when I became angry, I was anger. These feelings have to be controlled
in the germ, the root, in their fine forms, before even we have become
conscious that they are acting on us. With the vast majority of<!--'Volume 1 Page 242'-->
mankind the fine states of these passions are not even known &#8212; the
states in which they emerge from subconsciousness. When a bubble is
rising from the bottom of the lake, we do not see it, nor even when it
is nearly come to the surface; it is only when it bursts and makes a
ripple that we know it is there. We shall only be successful in
grappling with the waves when we can get hold of them in their fine
causes, and until you can get hold of them, and subdue them before they
become gross, there is no hope of conquering any passion perfectly. To
control our passions we have to control them at their very roots; then
alone shall we be able to burn out their very seeds. As fried seeds
thrown into the ground will never come up, so these passions will never
arise. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2375; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2367;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2360;&#2357;&#2361;&#2375;&#2351;&#2366;&#2307; &#2360;&#2370;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366;&#2307; &#2405;&#2407;&#2406;&#2405;
<a name="ii_10"></a><!--'Volume 1 Page 242'--></p>
<p>10. The fine Samskaras are to be conquered by resolving them
into their causal state. </p>
<p>Samskaras are the subtle impressions that manifest themselves
into gross forms later on. How are these fine Samskaras to be
controlled? By resolving the effect into its cause. When the Chitta,
which is an effect, is resolved into its cause, Asmitâ or Egoism, then
only, the fine impressions die along with it. Meditation cannot destroy
these. </p>
<p>&#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2344;&#2361;&#2375;&#2351;&#2366;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2342;&#2381;&#2357;&#2371;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2351;&#2307; &#2405;&#2407;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>11. By meditation, their (gross) modifications are to be
rejected. </p>
<p>Meditation is one of the great means of controlling the rising
of these waves. By meditation you can make the mind subdue these waves,
and if you go on practicing meditation for days, and months, and years,
until it has<!--'Volume 1 Page 243'--> become a habit,
until it will come in spite of yourself, anger and hatred will be
controlled and checked. </p>
<p>&#2325;&#2381;&#2354;&#2375;&#2358;&#2350;&#2370;&#2354;&#2307; &#2325;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366;&#2358;&#2351;&#2379; &#2342;&#2371;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2366;&#2342;&#2371;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2332;&#2344;&#2381;&#2350;&#2357;&#2375;&#2342;&#2344;&#2368;&#2351;&#2307; &#2405;&#2407;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>12. The "receptacle of works" has its root in these
pain-bearing obstructions, and their experience is in this visible
life, or in the unseen life. </p>
<p>By the "receptacle of works" is meant the sum-total of
Samskaras. Whatever work we do, the mind is thrown into a wave, and
after the work is finished, we think the wave is gone. No. It has only
become fine, but it is still there. When we try to remember the work,
it comes up again and becomes a wave. So it was there; if not, there
would not have been memory. Thus every action, every thought, good or
bad, just goes down and becomes fine, and is there stored up. Both
happy and unhappy thoughts are called pain-bearing obstructions,
because according to the Yogis, they, in the long run, bring pain. All
happiness which comes from the senses will, eventually, bring pain. All
enjoyment will make us thirst for more, and that brings pain as its
result. There is no limit to man's desires; he goes on desiring, and
when he comes to a point where desire cannot be fulfilled, the result
is pain. Therefore the Yogis regard the sum-total of the impressions,
good or evil, as pain-bearing obstructions; they obstruct the way to
freedom of the Soul. </p>
<p>It is the same with the Samskaras, the fine roots of all our
works; they are the causes which will again bring effects, either in
this life, or in the lives to come. In exceptional cases when these
Samskaras are very strong, they bear fruit quickly; exceptional acts of
wickedness, or of goodness, bring their fruits even in this life. The
Yogis hold that men who are able to acquire a tremendous power of good
Samskaras do not have to die, but, even in this life, can change their
bodies into god-bodies. There are<!--'Volume 1 Page 244'-->
several such cases mentioned by the Yogis in their books. These men
change the very material of their bodies; they re-arrange the molecules
in such fashion that they have no more sickness, and what we call death
does not come to them. Why should not this be? The physiological
meaning of food is assimilation of energy from the sun. The energy has
reached the plant, the plant is eaten by an animal, and the animal by
man. The science of it is that we take so much energy from the sun, and
make it part of ourselves. That being the case, why should there be
only one way of assimilating energy? The plant's way is not the same as
ours; the earth's process of assimilating energy differs from our own.
But all assimilate energy in some form or other. The Yogis say that
they are able to assimilate energy by the power of the mind alone, that
they can draw in as much of it as they desire without recourse to the
ordinary methods. As a spider makes its web out of its own substance,
and becomes bound in it, and cannot go anywhere except along the lines
of that web, so we have projected out of our own substance this network
called the nerves, and we cannot work except through the channels of
those nerves. The Yogi says we need not be bound by that.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can send electricity to any part of the world,
but we have to send it by means of wires. Nature can send a vast mass
of electricity without any wires at all. Why cannot we do the same? We
can send mental electricity. What we call mind is very much the same as
electricity. It is clear that this nerve fluid has some amount of
electricity, because it is polarised, and it answers all electrical
directions. We can only send our electricity through these nerve
channels. Why not send the mental electricity without this aid? The
Yogis say it is perfectly possible and practicable, and that when you
can do that, you will work all over the universe. You will be able to
work with any body anywhere, without the help of the<!--'Volume 1 Page 245'-->
nervous system. When the soul is acting through these channels, we say
a man is living, and when these cease to work, a man is said to be
dead. But when a man is able to act either with or without these
channels, birth and death will have no meaning for him. All the bodies
in the universe are made up of Tanmâtras, their difference lies in the
arrangement of the latter. If you are the arranger, you can arrange a
body in one way or another. Who makes up this body but you? Who eats
the food? If another ate the food for you, you would not live long. Who
makes the blood out of food? You, certainly. Who purifies the blood,
and sends it through the veins? You. We are the masters of the body,
and we live in it. Only we have lost the knowledge of how to rejuvenate
it. We have become automatic, degenerate. We have forgotten the process
of arranging its molecules. So, what we do automatically has to be done
knowingly. We are the masters and we have to regulate that arrangement;
and as soon as we can do that, we shall be able to rejuvenate just as
we like, and then we shall have neither birth nor disease nor death. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2340;&#2367; &#2350;&#2370;&#2354;&#2375; &#2340;&#2342;&#2381;&#2357;&#2367;&#2346;&#2366;&#2325;&#2379; &#2332;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2351;&#2369;&#2352;&#2381;&#2349;&#2379;&#2327;&#2366;&#2307; &#2405;&#2407;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>13. The root being there, the fruition comes (in the form of)
species, life, and experience of pleasure and pain. </p>
<p>The roots, the causes, the Samskaras being there, they
manifest and form the effects. The cause dying down becomes the effect;
the effect getting subtler becomes the cause of the next effect. A tree
bears a seed, which becomes the cause of another tree, and so on. All
our works now are the effects of past Samskaras; again, these works
becoming Samskaras will be the causes of future actions, and thus we go
on. So this aphorism says that the cause being there, the fruit must
come, in the form of species of<!--'Volume 1 Page 246'-->
beings: one will be a man, another an angel, another an animal, another
a demon. Then there are different effects of Karma in life. One man
lives fifty years, another a hundred, another dies in two years, and
never attains maturity; all these differences in life are regulated by
past Karma. One man is born, as it were, for pleasure; if he buries
himself in a forest, pleasure will follow him there. Another man,
wherever he goes, is followed by pain; everything becomes painful for
him. It is the result of their own past. According to the philosophy of
the Yogis, all virtuous actions bring pleasure, and all vicious actions
bring pain. Any man who does wicked deeds is sure to reap their fruit
in the form of pain. </p>

<p>15. To the discriminating, all is, as it were, painful on
account of everything bringing pain either as consequence, or as
anticipation of loss of happiness, or as fresh craving arising from
impressions of happiness, and also as counteraction of qualities. </p>
<p>The Yogis say that the man who has discriminating powers, the
man of good sense, sees through all that are called pleasure and pain,
and knows that they come to all, and that one follows and melts into
the other; he sees that men follow an <i>ignis fatuus</i>
all their lives, and never succeed in fulfilling their desires. The
great king Yudhishthira once said that the most wonderful thing in life
is that every moment we see people dying around us, and<!--'Volume 1 Page 247'-->
yet we think we shall never die. Surrounded by fools on every side, we
think we are the only exceptions, the only learned men. Surrounded by
all sorts of experiences of fickleness, we think our love is the only
lasting love. How can that be? Even love is selfish, and the Yogi says
that in the end we shall find that even the love of husbands and wives,
and children and friends, slowly decays. Decadence seizes everything in
this life. It is only when everything, even love, fails, that, with a
flash, man finds out how vain, how dream-like is this world. Then he
catches a glimpse of Vairâgya (renunciation), catches a glimpse of the
Beyond. It is only by giving up this world that the other comes; never
through holding on to this one. Never yet was there a great soul who
had not to reject sense-pleasures and enjoyments to acquire his
greatness. The cause of misery is the clash between the different
forces of nature, one dragging one way, and another dragging another,
rendering permanent happiness impossible. </p>
<p>&#2361;&#2375;&#2351;&#2306; &#2342;&#2369;&#2307;&#2326;&#2350;&#2344;&#2366;&#2327;&#2340;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2407;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>16. The misery which is not yet come is to be avoided. </p>
<p>Some Karma we have worked out already, some we are working out
now in the present, and some are waiting to bear fruit in the future.
The first kind is past and gone. The second we will have to work out,
and it is only that which is waiting to bear fruit in the future that
we can conquer and control, towards which end all our forces should be
directed. This is what Patanjali means when he says that Samskaras are
to be controlled by resolving them into their causal state (<a href="concentration_its_practice.htm#ii_10">II. l0</a>).

<p>17. The cause of that which is to be avoided is the junction
of the seer and the seen. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 248'-->
<p>Who is the seer? The Self of man, the Purusha. What is the
seen? The whole of nature beginning with the mind, down to gross
matter. All pleasure and pain arise from the junction between this
Purusha and the mind. The Purusha, you must remember, according to this
philosophy, is pure; when joined to nature, it appears to feel pleasure
or pain by reflection. </p>

<p>18. The experienced is composed of elements and organs, is of
the nature of illumination, action, and inertia, and is for the purpose
of experience and release (of the experiencer). </p>
<p>The experienced, that is nature, is composed of elements and
organs &#8212; the elements, gross and fine, which compose the whole of
nature, and the organs of the senses, mind, etc. &#8212; and is of the nature
of illumination (Sattva), action (Rajas), and inertia (Tamas). What is
the purpose of the whole of nature? That the Purusha may gain
experience. The Purusha has, as it were, forgotten its mighty, godly
nature. There is a story that the king of the gods, Indra, once became
a pig, wallowing in mire; he had a she-pig and a lot of baby pigs, and
was very happy. Then some gods saw his plight, and came to him, and
told him, "You are the king of the gods, you have all the gods under
your command. Why are you here?" But Indra said, "Never mind; I am all
right here; I do not care for heaven, while I have this sow and these
little pigs." The poor gods were at their wits' end. After a time they
decided to slay all the pigs one after another. When all were dead,
Indra began to weep and mourn. Then the gods ripped his pig-body open
and he came out of it, and began to laugh, when he realised what a
hideous dream he had had &#8212; he, the king<!--'Volume 1 Page 249'-->
of the gods, to have become a pig, and to think that that pig-life was
the only life! Not only so, but to have wanted the whole universe to
come into the pig-life! The Purusha, when it identifies itself with
nature, forgets that it is pure and infinite. The Purusha does not
love, it is love itself. It does not exist, it is existence itself. The
Soul does not know, It is knowledge itself. It is a mistake to say the
Soul loves, exists, or knows. Love, existence, and knowledge are not
the qualities of the Purusha, but its essence. When they get reflected
upon something, you may call them the qualities of that something. They
are not the qualities but the essence of the Purusha, the great Atman,
the Infinite Being, without birth or death, established in its own
glory. It appears to have become so degenerate that if you approach to
tell it, "You are not a pig," it begins to squeal and bite. </p>
<p>Thus is it with us all in this Mâyâ, this dream world, where
it is all misery, weeping and crying, where a few golden balls are
rolled, and the world scrambles after them. You were never bound by
laws, nature never had a bond for you. That is what the Yogi tells you.
Have patience to learn it. And the Yogi shows how, by junction with
nature, and identifying itself with the mind and the world, the Purusha
thinks itself miserable. Then the Yogi goes on to show you that the way
out is through experience. You have to get all this experience, but
finish it quickly. We have placed ourselves in this net, and will have
to get out. We have got ourselves caught in the trap, and we will have
to work out our freedom. So get this experience of husbands, and wives,
and friends, and little loves; you will get through them safely if you
never forget what you really are. Never forget this is only a momentary
state, and that w e have to pass through it. Experience is the one
great teacher &#8212; experience of pleasure and pain &#8212; but know it is only
experience.<!--'Volume 1 Page 250'--> It leads, step by
step, to that state where all things become small, and the Purusha so
great that the whole universe seems as a drop in the ocean and falls
off by its own nothingness. We have to go through different
experiences, but let us never forget the ideal. </p>
<p>&#2357;&#2367;&#2358;&#2375;&#2359;&#2366;&#2357;&#2367;&#2358;&#2375;&#2359;-&#2354;&#2367;&#2329;&#2381;&#2327;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2354;&#2367;&#2329;&#2381;&#2327;&#2366;&#2344;&#2367; &#2327;&#2369;&#2339;&#2346;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2339;&#2367; &#2405;&#2407;&#2415;&#2405;</p>
<p>19. The states of the qualities are the defined, the
undefined, the indicated only, and the signless. </p>
<p>The system of Yoga is built entirely on the philosophy of the
Sânkhyas, as I told you before, and here again I shall remind you of
the cosmology of the Sankhya philosophy. According to the Sankhyas,
nature is both the material and the efficient cause of the universe. In
nature there are three sorts of materials, the Sattva, the Rajas, and
the Tamas. The Tamas material is all that is dark, all that is ignorant
and heavy. The Rajas is activity. The Sattva is calmness, light.
Nature, before creation, is called by them Avyakta, undefined, or
indiscrete; that is, in which there is no distinction of form or name,
a state in which these three materials are held in perfect balance.
Then the balance is disturbed, the three materials begin to mingle in
various fashions, and the result is the universe. In every man, also,
these three materials exist. When the Sattva material prevails,
knowledge comes; when Rajas, activity; and when Tamas, darkness,
lassitude, idleness, and ignorance. According to the Sankhya theory,
the highest manifestation of nature, consisting of the three materials,
is what they call Mahat or intelligence, universal intelligence, of
which each human intellect is a part. In the Sankhya psychology there
is a sharp distinction between Manas, the mind function, and the
function of the Buddhi, intellect. The mind function is simply to
collect and carry impressions and present them to the Buddhi,<!--'Volume 1 Page 251'-->
the individual Mahat, which determines upon it. Out of Mahat comes
egoism, out of which again come the fine materials. The fine materials
combine and become the gross materials outside &#8212; the external universe.
The claim of the Sankhya philosophy is that beginning with the
intellect down to a block of stone, all is the product of one
substance, different only as finer to grosser states of existence. The
finer is the cause, and the grosser is the effect. According. to the
Sankhya philosophy, beyond the whole of nature is the Purusha, which is
not material at all. Purusha is not at all similar to anything else,
either Buddhi, or mind, or the Tanmatras, or the gross materials. It is
not akin to any one of these, it is entirely separate, entirely
different in its nature, and from this they argue that the Purusha must
be immortal, because it is not the result of combination. That which is
not the result of combination cannot die. The Purushas or souls are
infinite in number. </p>
<p>Now we shall understand the aphorism that the states of the
qualities are defined, undefined, indicated only, and signess. By the
"defined" are meant the gross elements, which we can sense. By the
"undefined" are meant the very fine materials, the Tanmatras, which
cannot be sensed by ordinary men. If you practise Yoga, however, says
Patanjali, after a while your perceptions will become so fine that you
will actually see the Tanmatras. For instance, you have heard how every
man has a certain light about him; every living being emits a certain
light, and this, he says, can be seen by the Yogi. We do not all see
it, but we all throw out these Tanmatras, just as a flower continuously
sends out fine particles which enable us to smell it. Every day of our
lives we throw out a mass of good or evil, and everywhere we go the
atmosphere is full of these materials. That is how there came to the
human mind, unconsciously, the idea of building temples and churches.
Why should man build churches in which to worship God?<!--'Volume 1 Page 252'-->
Why not worship Him anywhere? Even if he did not know the reason, man
found that the place where people worshipped God became full of good
Tanmatras. Every day people go there, and the more they go the holier
they get, and the holier that place becomes. If any man who has not
much Sattva in him goes there, the place will influence him and arouse
his Sattva quality. Here, therefore, is the significance of all temples
and holy places, but you must remember that their holiness depends on
holy people congregating there. The difficulty with man is that he
forgets the original meaning, and puts the cart before the horse. It
was men who made these places holy, and then the effect became the
cause and made men holy. If the wicked only were to go there, it would
become as bad as any other place. It is not the building, but the
people that make a church, and that is what we always forget. That is
why sages and holy persons, who have much of this Sattva quality, can
send it out and exert a tremendous influence day and night on their
surroundings. A man may become so pure that his purity will become
tangible. Whosoever comes in contact with him becomes pure. </p>
<p>Next "the indicated only" means the Buddhi, the intellect.
"The indicated only" is the first manifestation of nature; from it all
other manifestations proceed. The last is "the signless". There seems
to be a great difference between modern science and all religions at
this point. Every religion has the idea that the universe comes out of
intelligence. The theory of God, taking it in its psychological
significance, apart from all ideas of personality, is that intelligence
is first in the order of creation, and that out of intelligence comes
what we call gross matter. Modern philosophers say that intelligence is
the last to come. They say that unintelligent things slowly evolve into
animals, and from animals into men. They claim that instead of
everything coming out of intelligence, intelligence itself is the last
to come. Both the religious and the<!--'Volume 1 Page 253'-->
scientific statements, though seeming directly opposed to each other
are true. Take an infinite series, A&#8212;B&#8212;A&#8212;B &#8212;A&#8212;B. etc. The question is &#8212;
which is first, A or B? If you take the series as A&#8212;B. you will say
that A is first, but if you take it as B&#8212;A, you will say that B is
first. It depends upon the way we look at it. Intelligence undergoes
modification and becomes the gross matter, this again merges into
intelligence, and thus the process goes on. The Sankhyas, and other
religionists, put intelligence first, and the series becomes
intelligence, then matter. The scientific man puts his finger on
matter, and says matter, then intelligence. They both indicate the same
chain. Indian philosophy, however, goes beyond both intelligence and
matter, and finds a Purusha, or Self, which is beyond intelligence, of
which intelligence is but the borrowed light. </p>
<p>&#2342;&#2381;&#2352;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2366; &#2342;&#2371;&#2358;&#2367;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2307; &#2358;&#2369;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2379;&#2365;&#2346;&#2367; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2351;&#2366;&#2344;&#2369;&#2346;&#2358;&#2381;&#2351;&#2307; &#2405;&#2408;&#2406;&#2405;</p>
<p>20. The seer is intelligence only, and though pure, sees
through the colouring of the intellect. </p>
<p>This is, again, Sankhya philosophy. We have seen from the same
philosophy that from the lowest form up to intelligence all is nature;
beyond nature are Purushas (souls), which have no qualities. Then how
does the soul appear to be happy or unhappy? By reflection. If a red
flower is put near a piece of pure crystal, the crystal appears to be
red, similarly the appearances of happiness or unhappiness of the soul
are but reflections. The soul itself has no colouring. The soul is
separate from nature. Nature is one thing, soul another, eternally
separate. The Sankhyas say that intelligence is a compound, that it
grows and wanes, that it changes, just as the body changes, and that
its nature is nearly the same as that of the body. As a finger-nail is
to the body, so is body to intelligence. The nail is a part of the
body, but it can be pared off hundreds of times, and the body will
still last. Similarly, the<!--'Volume 1 Page 254'-->
intelligence lasts aeons, while this body can be "pared off," thrown
off. Yet intelligence cannot be immortal because it changes &#8212; growing
and waning. Anything that changes cannot be immortal. Certainly
intelligence is manufactured, and that very fact shows us that there
must be something beyond that. It cannot be free, everything connected
with matter is in nature, and, therefore, bound for ever. Who is free?
The free must certainly be beyond cause and effect. If you say that the
idea of freedom is a delusion, I shall say that the idea of bondage is
also a delusion. Two facts come into our consciousness, and stand or
fall with each other. These are our notions of bondage and freedom. If
we want to go through a wall, and our head bumps against that wall, we
see we are limited by that wall. At the same time we find a willpower,
and think we can direct our will everywhere. At every step these
contradictory ideas come to us. We have to believe that we are free,
yet at every moment we find we are not free. If one idea is a delusion,
the other is also a delusion, and if one is true, the other also is
true, because both stand upon the same basis &#8212; consciousness. The Yogi
says, both are true; that we are bound so far as intelligence goes,
that we are free so far as the soul is concerned. It is the real nature
of man, the soul, the Purusha, which is beyond all law of causation.
Its freedom is percolating through layers of matter in various forms,
intelligence, mind, etc. It is its light which is shining through all.
Intelligence has no light of its own. Each organ has a particular
centre in the brain; it is not that all the organs have one centre;
each organ is separate. Why do all perceptions harmonise? Where do they
get their unity? If it were in the brain, it would be necessary for all
the organs, the eyes, the nose, the ears, etc., to have one centre
only, while we know for certain that there are different centres for
each. Both a man can see and hear at the same time, so a unity must be
there at the back of<!--'Volume 1 Page 255'-->
intelligence. Intelligence is connected with the brain, but behind
intelligence even stands the Purusha, the unit, where all different
sensations and perceptions join and become one. The soul itself is the
centre where all the different perceptions converge and become unified.
That soul is free, and it is its freedom that tells you every moment
that you are free. But you mistake, and mingle that freedom every
moment with intelligence and mind. You try to attribute that freedom to
the intelligence, and immediately find that intelligence is not free;
you attribute that freedom to the body, and immediately nature tells
you that you are again mistaken. That is why there is this mingled
sense of freedom and bondage at the same time. The Yogi analyses both
what is free and what is bound, and his ignorance vanishes. He finds
that the Purusha is free, is the essence of that knowledge which,
coming through the Buddhi, becomes intelligence, and, as such, is
bound. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2342;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341; &#2319;&#2357; &#2342;&#2371;&#2358;&#2381;&#2351;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366; &#2405;&#2408;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>21. The nature of the experienced is for him. </p>
<p>Nature has no light of its own. As long as the Purusha is
present in it, it appears as light. But the light is borrowed; just as
the moon's light is reflected. According to the Yogis, all the
manifestations of nature are caused by nature itself, but nature has no
purpose in view, except to free the Purusha. </p>
<p>&#2325;&#2371;&#2340;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2306; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2367; &#2344;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2350;&#2346;&#2381;&#2351;&#2344;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2306; &#2340;&#2342;&#2344;&#2381;&#2351;&#2360;&#2366;&#2343;&#2366;&#2352;&#2339;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2405;&#2408;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>22. Though destroyed for him whose goal has been gained, yet
it is not destroyed, being common to others. </p>
<p>The whole activity of nature is to make the soul know that it
is entirely separate from nature. When the soul knows this, nature has
no more attractions for it. But<!--'Volume 1 Page 256'-->
the whole of nature vanishes only for that man who has become free.
There will always remain an infinite number of others, for whom nature
will go on working. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2350;&#2367;&#2358;&#2325;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2379;&#2307; &#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2370;&#2346;&#2379;&#2346;&#2354;&#2348;&#2381;&#2343;&#2367;&#2361;&#2375;&#2340;&#2369;&#2307; &#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2307; &#2405;&#2408;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>23. Junction is the cause of the realization of the nature of
both the powers, the experienced and its Lord. </p>
<p>According to this aphorism, both the powers of soul and nature
become manifest when they are in conjunction. Then all manifestations
are thrown out. Ignorance is the cause of this conjunction. We see
every day that the cause of our pain or pleasure is always our joining
ourselves with the body. If I were perfectly certain that I am not this
body, I should take no notice of heat and cold, or anything of the
kind. This body is a combination. It is only a fiction to say that I
have one body, you another, and the sun another. The whole universe is
one ocean of matter, and you are the name of a little particle, and I
of another, and the sun of another. We know that this matter is
continuously changing. What is forming the sun one day, the next day
may form the matter of our bodies. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2361;&#2375;&#2340;&#2369;&#2352;&#2357;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366; &#2405;&#2408;&#2410;&#2405;</p>
<p>24. Ignorance is its cause. </p>
<p>Through ignorance we have joined ourselves with a particular
body, and thus opened ourselves to misery. This idea of body is a
simple superstition. It is superstition that makes us happy or unhappy.
It is superstition caused by ignorance that makes us feel heat and
cold, pain and pleasure. It is our business to rise above this
superstition, and the Yogi shows us how we can do this. It has been
demonstrated that, under certain mental conditions, a man may be
burned, yet he will feel no pain. The difficulty is that this sudden
upheaval of the mind comes like a<!--'Volume 1 Page 257'-->
whirlwind one minute, and goes away the next. If, however, we gain it
through Yoga, we shall permanently attain to the separation of Self
from the body. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2342;&#2349;&#2366;&#2357;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2360;&#2306;&#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2366;&#2349;&#2366;&#2357;&#2379; &#2361;&#2366;&#2344;&#2306; &#2340;&#2342;&#2381;&#2342;&#2371;&#2358;&#2375;&#2307; &#2325;&#2376;&#2357;&#2354;&#2381;&#2351;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2408;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>25. There being absence of that (ignorance) there is absence
of junction, which is the thing-to-be avoided; that is the independence
of the seer. </p>
<p>According to Yoga philosophy, it is through ignorance that the
soul has been joined with nature. The aim is to get rid of nature's
control over us. That is the goal of all religions. Each soul is
potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within, by
controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or
worship, or psychic control, or philosophy &#8212; by one or more or all of
these &#8212; and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or
dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary
details. The Yogi tries to reach this goal through psychic control.
Until we can free ourselves from nature, we are slaves; as she dictates
so we must go. The Yogi claims that he who controls mind controls
matter also. The internal nature is much higher than the external and
much more difficult to grapple with, much more difficult to control.
Therefore he who has conquered the internal nature controls the whole
universe; it becomes his servant. Raja-Yoga propounds the methods of
gaining this control. Forces higher than we know in physical nature
will have to be subdued. This body is just the external crust of the
mind. They are not two different things; they are just as the oyster
and its shell. They are but two aspects of one thing; the internal
substance of the oyster takes up matter from outside, and manufactures
the shell. In the same way the internal fine forces which are called
mind take up gross matter from outside, and from that manufacture this
external shell, the body.<!--'Volume 1 Page 258'--> If,
then, we have control of the internal, it is very easy to have control
of the external. Then again, these forces are not different. It is not
that some forces are physical, and some mental; the physical forces are
but the gross manifestations of the fine forces, just as the physical
world is but the gross manifestation of the fine world. </p>
<p>&#2357;&#2367;&#2357;&#2375;&#2325;&#2326;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2367;&#2352;&#2357;&#2367;&#2346;&#2381;&#2354;&#2357;&#2366; &#2361;&#2366;&#2344;&#2379;&#2346;&#2366;&#2351;&#2307; &#2405;&#2408;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>26. The means of destruction of ignorance is unbroken practice
of discrimination. </p>
<p>This is the real goal of practice &#8212; discrimination between the
real and the unreal, knowing that the Purusha is not nature, that it is
neither matter nor mind, and that because it is not nature, it cannot
possibly change. It is only nature which changes, combining and
re-combining, dissolving continually. When through constant practice we
begin to discriminate, ignorance will vanish, and the Purusha will
begin to shine in its real nature &#8212; omniscient, omnipotent,
omnipresent. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2360;&#2346;&#2381;&#2340;&#2343;&#2366; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2349;&#2370;&#2350;&#2367;&#2307; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366; &#2405;&#2408;&#2413;&#2405;</p>
<p>27. His knowledge is of the sevenfold highest ground. </p>
<p>When this knowledge comes; it will come, as it were, in seven
grades, one after the other; and when one of these begins, we know that
we are getting knowledge. The first to appear will be that we have
known what is to be known. The mind will cease to be dissatisfied.
While we are aware of thirsting after knowledge, we begin to seek here
and there, wherever we think we can get some truth, and failing to find
it we become dissatisfied and seek in a fresh direction. All search is
vain, until we begin to perceive that knowledge is within ourselves,
that no one can help us, that we must help ourselves. When we begin to<!--'Volume 1 Page 259'-->
practise the power of discrimination, the first sign that we are
getting near truth will be that that dissatisfied state will vanish. We
shall feel quite sure that we have found the truth, and that it cannot
be anything else but the truth. Then we may know that the sun is
rising, that the morning is breaking for us, and taking courage, we
must persevere until the goal is reached. The second grade will be the
absence of all pains. It will be impossible for anything in the
universe, external or internal, to give us pain. The third will be the
attainment of full knowledge. Omniscience will be ours. The fourth will
be the attainment of the end of all duty through discrimination. Next
will come what is called freedom of the Chitta. We shall realise that
all difficulties and struggles, all vacillations of the mind, have
fallen down, just as a stone rolls from the mountain top into the
valley and never comes up again. The next will be that the Chitta
itself will realise that it melts away into its causes whenever we so
desire. Lastly we shall find that we are established in our Self, that
we have been alone throughout the universe, neither body nor mind was
ever related, much less joined, to us. They were working their own way,
and we, through ignorance, joined ourselves to them. But we have been
alone, omnipotent, omnipresent, ever blessed; our own Self was so pure
and perfect that we required none else. We required none else to make
us happy, for we are happiness itself. We shall find that this
knowledge does not depend on anything else; throughout the universe
there can be nothing that will not become effulgent before our
knowledge. This will be the last state, and the Yogi will become
peaceful and calm, never to feel any more pain, never to be again
deluded, never to be touched by misery. He will know he is ever
blessed, ever perfect, almighty. </p>
<p>&#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2366;&#2329;&#2381;&#2327;&#2366;&#2344;&#2369;&#2359;&#2381;&#2336;&#2366;&#2344;&#2366;&#2342;&#2358;&#2369;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2367;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2351;&#2375; &#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2342;&#2368;&#2346;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;&#2352;&#2366; &#2357;&#2367;&#2357;&#2375;&#2325;&#2326;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2375;&#2307; &#2405;&#2408;&#2414;&#2405;</p>
<p>28. By the practice of the different parts of<!--'Volume 1 Page 260'-->
Yoga the impurities being destroyed, knowledge be comes effulgent up to
discrimination. </p>
<p>Now comes the practical knowledge. What we have just been
speaking about is much higher. It is away above our heads, but it is
the ideal. It is first necessary to obtain physical and mental control.
Then the realization will become steady in that ideal. The ideal being
known, what remains is to practice the method of reaching it. </p>
<p>&#2351;&#2350;-&#2344;&#2367;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2360;&#2344;-&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2339;&#2366;&#2351;&#2366;&#2350;-&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2361;&#2366;&#2352;-&#2343;&#2366;&#2352;&#2339;&#2366;-&#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2344;-&#2360;&#2350;&#2366;&#2343;&#2351;&#2379;&#2365;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2366;&#2357;&#2329;&#2381;&#2327;&#2366;&#2344;&#2367;
&#2405;&#2408;&#2415;&#2405;</p>
<p>29. Yama, Niyama, Âsana, Prânâyâama, Pratyâhâra, Dhâranâ,
Dhyâna, and Samâdhi are the eight limbs of Yoga. </p>
<p>&#2309;&#2361;&#2367;&#2306;&#2360;&#2366;-&#2360;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2375;&#2351;-&#2348;&#2381;&#2352;&#2361;&#2381;&#2350;&#2330;&#2352;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2346;&#2352;&#2367;&#2327;&#2381;&#2352;&#2361;&#2366; &#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2307; &#2405;&#2409;&#2406;&#2405;</p>
<p>30. Non-killing, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and
nor-receiving are called Yamas. </p>
<p>A man who wants to be a perfect Yogi must give up the sex
idea. The soul has no sex; why should it degrade itself with sex ideas?
Later on we shall understand better why these ideas must be given up.
The mind of the man who receives gifts is acted on by the mind of the
giver, so the receiver is likely to become degenerated. Receiving gifts
is prone to destroy the independence of the mind, and make us slavish.
Therefore, receive no gifts. </p>
<p>&#2319;&#2340;&#2375; &#2332;&#2366;&#2340;&#2367;-&#2342;&#2375;&#2358;-&#2325;&#2366;&#2354;-&#2360;&#2350;&#2351;&#2366;&#2344;&#2357;&#2330;&#2381;&#2331;&#2367;&#2344;&#2381;&#2344;&#2366;&#2307; &#2360;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2349;&#2380;&#2350;&#2366; &#2350;&#2361;&#2366;&#2357;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>31. These, unbroken by time, place, purpose, and caste-rules,
are (universal) great vows. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 261'-->
<p>These practices &#8212; non-killing, truthfulness, non-stealing,
chastity, and non-receiving &#8212; are to be practised by every man, woman,
and child; by every soul, irrespective of nation, country, or position.
</p>
<p>&#2358;&#2380;&#2330;-&#2360;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2379;&#2359;-&#2340;&#2346;&#2307;&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2351;&#2375;&#2358;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2339;&#2367;&#2343;&#2366;&#2344;&#2366;&#2344;&#2367; &#2344;&#2367;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2307; &#2405;&#2409;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>32. Internal and external purification, contentment,
mortification, study, and worship of God are the Niyamas. </p>
<p>External purification is keeping the body pure; a dirty man
will never be a Yogi. There must be internal purification also. That is
obtained by the virtues named in I.33. Of course, internal purity is of
greater value than external, but both are necessary, and external
purity, without internal, is of no good. </p>
<p>&#2357;&#2367;&#2340;&#2352;&#2381;&#2325;&#2348;&#2366;&#2343;&#2344;&#2375; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2367;&#2346;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2349;&#2366;&#2357;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>33. To obstruct thoughts which are inimical to Yoga, contrary
thoughts should be brought. </p>
<p>That is the way to practise the virtues that have been stated.
For instance, when a big wave of anger has come into the mind, how are
we to control that? Just by raising an opposing wave. Think of love.
Sometimes a mother is very angry with her husband, and while in that
state, the baby comes in, and she kisses the baby; the old wave dies
out and a new wave arises, love for the child. That suppresses the
other one. Love is opposite to anger. Similarly, when the idea of
stealing comes, non-stealing should be thought of; when the idea of
receiving gifts comes, replace it by a contrary thought. </p>
<p>&#2357;&#2367;&#2340;&#2352;&#2381;&#2325;&#2366; &#2361;&#2367;&#2306;&#2360;&#2366;&#2342;&#2351;&#2307; &#2325;&#2371;&#2340;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352;&#2367;&#2340;&#2366;&#2344;&#2369;&#2350;&#2379;&#2342;&#2367;&#2340;&#2366; &#2354;&#2379;&#2349;&#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2379;&#2343;&#2350;&#2379;&#2361;&#2346;&#2370;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2325;&#2366;
&#2350;&#2371;&#2342;&#2369;&#2350;&#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2343;&#2367;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366; &#2342;&#2369;&#2307;&#2326;&#2366;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2344;&#2366;&#2344;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2347;&#2354;&#2366; &#2311;&#2340;&#2367; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2367;&#2346;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2349;&#2366;&#2357;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2410;&#2405;</p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 262'-->
<p>34. The obstructions to Yoga are killing, falsehood, etc.,
whether committed, caused, or approved; either through avarice, or
anger, or ignorance; whether slight, middling, or great; and they
result in infinite ignorance and misery. This is (the method of)
thinking the contrary. </p>
<p>If I tell a lie, or cause another to tell one, or approve of
another doing so, it is equally sinful. If it is a very mild lie, still
it is a lie. Every vicious thought will rebound, every thought of
hatred which you may have thought, in a cave even, is stored up, and
will one day come back to you with tremendous power in the form of some
misery here. If you project hatred and jealousy, they will rebound on
you with compound interest. No power can avert them; when once you have
put them in motion, you will have to bear them. Remembering this will
prevent you from doing wicked things. </p>
<p>&#2309;&#2361;&#2367;&#2306;&#2360;&#2366;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2336;&#2366;&#2351;&#2366;&#2306; &#2340;&#2340;&#2381;&#2360;&#2344;&#2381;&#2344;&#2367;&#2343;&#2380; &#2357;&#2376;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2327;&#2307; &#2405;&#2409;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>35. Non-killing being established, in his presence all
enmities cease (in others).</p>
<p>If a man gets the ideal of non-injuring others, before him
even animals which are by their nature ferocious will become peaceful.
The tiger and the lamb will play together before that Yogi. When you
have come to that state, then alone you will understand that you have
become firmly established in non-injuring. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2336;&#2366;&#2351;&#2366;&#2306; &#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2351;&#2366;&#2347;&#2354;&#2366;&#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2351;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>36. By the establishment of truthfulness the Yogi gets the
power of attaining for himself and others the fruits of work without
the works. </p>
<p>When this power of truth will be established with you,<!--'Volume 1 Page 263'-->
then even in dream you will never tell an untruth. You will be true in
thought, word, and deed. Whatever you say will be truth. You may say to
a man, "Be blessed," and that man will be blessed. If a man is
diseased, and you say to him, "Be thou cured," he will be cured
immediately. </p>
<p>&#2309;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2375;&#2351;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2336;&#2366;&#2351;&#2366;&#2306; &#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2344;&#2379;&#2346;&#2360;&#2381;&#2341;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2409;&#2413;&#2405;</p>
<p>37. By the establishment of non-stealing all wealth comes to
the Yogi. </p>
<p>The more you fly from nature, the more she follows you; and if
you do not care for her at all, she becomes your slave. </p>
<p>&#2348;&#2381;&#2352;&#2361;&#2381;&#2350;&#2330;&#2352;&#2381;&#2351;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2336;&#2366;&#2351;&#2366;&#2306; &#2357;&#2368;&#2352;&#2381;&#2351;&#2354;&#2366;&#2349;&#2307; &#2405;&#2409;&#2414;&#2405;</p>
<p>38. By the establishment of continence energy is gained. </p>
<p>The chaste brain has tremendous energy and gigantic
will-power. Without chastity there can be no spiritual strength.
Continence gives wonderful control over mankind. The spiritual leaders
of men have been very continent, and this is what gave them power.
Therefore the Yogi must be continent. </p>
<p>&#2309;&#2346;&#2352;&#2367;&#2327;&#2381;&#2352;&#2361;&#2360;&#2381;&#2341;&#2376;&#2352;&#2381;&#2351;&#2375; &#2332;&#2344;&#2381;&#2350;&#2325;&#2341;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2366;&#2360;&#2306;&#2348;&#2379;&#2343;&#2307; &#2405;&#2409;&#2415;&#2405;</p>
<p>39. When he is fixed in non-receiving, he gets the memory of
past life.</p>
<p>When a man does not receive presents, he does not become
beholden to others, but remains independent and free. His mind becomes
pure. With every gift, he is likely to receive the evils of the giver.
If he does not receive, the mind is purified, and the first power it
gets is memory of past life. Then alone the Yogi becomes perfectly
fixed in his ideal. He sees that he has been coming<!--'Volume 1 Page 264'-->
and going many times, so he becomes determined that this time he will
be free, that he will no more come and go, and be the slave of Nature. </p>
<p>&#2358;&#2380;&#2330;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2329;&#2381;&#2327;&#2332;&#2369;&#2327;&#2369;&#2346;&#2381;&#2360;&#2366; &#2346;&#2352;&#2376;&#2352;&#2360;&#2306;&#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2327;&#2307; &#2405;&#2410;&#2406;&#2405;</p>
<p>40. Internal and external cleanliness being established, there
arises disgust for one's own body, and non-intercourse with others. </p>
<p>When there is real purification of the body, external and
internal, there arises neglect of the body, and the idea of keeping it
nice vanishes. A face which others call most beautiful will appear to
the Yogi as merely animal, if there is not intelligence behind it. What
the world calls a very common face he regards as heavenly, if the
spirit shines behind it. This thirst after body is the great bane of
human life. So the first sign of the establishment of purity is that
you do not care to think you are a body. It is only when purity comes
that we get rid of the body idea.</p>
<p>&#2360;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2358;&#2369;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2367;-&#2360;&#2380;&#2350;&#2344;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351;&#2376;&#2325;&#2366;&#2327;&#2381;&#2352;&#2381;&#2351;&#2375;&#2344;&#2381;&#2342;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2351;&#2332;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2342;&#2352;&#2381;&#2358;&#2344;-&#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2381;&#2351;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2344;&#2367; &#2330;
&#2405;&#2410;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>41. There also arises purification of the Sattva, cheerfulness
of the mind, concentration, conquest of the organs, and fitness for the
realisation of the Self. </p>
<p>By the practice of cleanliness, the Sattva material prevails,
and the mind becomes concentrated and cheerful. The first sign that you
are becoming religious is that you are becoming cheerful. When a man is
gloomy, that may be dyspepsia, but it is not religion. A pleasurable
feeling is the nature of the Sattva. Everything is pleasurable to the
Sâttvika man, and when this comes, know that you are progressing in
Yoga. All pain is caused by Tamas, so you must get rid of that;
moroseness is one of the Exults of Tamas. The strong, the well knit,
the young, the healthy, the daring alone are fit to be Yogis. To the
Yogi everything is bliss,<!--'Volume 1 Page 265'--> every
human face that he sees brings cheerfulness to him. That is the sign of
a virtuous man. Misery is caused by sin, and by no other cause. What
business have you with clouded faces? It is terrible. If you have a
clouded face, do not go out that day, shut yourself up in your room.
What right have you to carry this disease out into the world ? When
your mind has become controlled, you have control over the whole body;
instead of being a slave to this machine, the machine is your slave.
Instead of this machine being able to drag the soul down, it becomes
its greatest helpmate. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2379;&#2359;&#2366;&#2342;&#2344;&#2369;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2350;&#2307; &#2360;&#2369;&#2326;&#2354;&#2366;&#2349;&#2307; &#2405;&#2410;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>42. From contentment comes superlative happiness. </p>
<p>&#2325;&#2366;&#2351;&#2375;&#2344;&#2381;&#2342;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2351;&#2360;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2367;&#2352;&#2358;&#2369;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2367;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2346;&#2360;&#2307; &#2405;&#2410;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>43. The result of mortification is bringing powers to the
organs and the body, by destroying the impurity. </p>
<p>The results of mortification are seen immediately, sometimes
by heightened powers of vision, hearing things at a distance, and so
on. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2343;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2351;&#2366;&#2342;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2342;&#2375;&#2357;&#2340;&#2366;&#2360;&#2306;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2307; &#2405;&#2410;&#2410;&#2405;</p>
<p>44. By the repetition of the Mantra comes the realisation of
the intended deity. </p>
<p>The higher the beings that you want to get the harder is the
practice. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2350;&#2366;&#2343;&#2367;&#2360;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2367;&#2352;&#2368;&#2358;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2339;&#2367;&#2343;&#2366;&#2344;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2405;&#2410;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>45. By sacrificing all to Ishvara comes Samadhi. </p>
<p>By resignation to the Lord, Samadhi becomes perfect. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 266'-->
<p>&#2360;&#2381;&#2341;&#2367;&#2352;&#2360;&#2369;&#2326;&#2350;&#2366;&#2360;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2410;&#2412;&#2405;</p>
<p>46. Posture is that which is firm and pleasant. </p>
<p>Now comes Asana, posture. Until you can get a firm seat you
cannot practice the breathing and other exercises. Firmness of seat
means that you do not feel the body at all. In the ordinary way, you
will find that as soon as you sit for a few minutes all sorts of
disturbances come into the body; but when you have got beyond the idea
of a concrete body, you will lose all sense of the body. You will feel
neither pleasure nor pain. And when you take your body up again, it
will feel so rested. It is only perfect rest that you can give to the
body. When you have succeeded in conquering the body and keeping it
firm, your practice will remain firm, but while you are disturbed by
the body, your nerves become disturbed, and you cannot concentrate the
mind. </p>
<p>&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2351;&#2340;&#2381;&#2344;&#2358;&#2376;&#2341;&#2367;&#2354;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2344;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2360;&#2350;&#2366;&#2346;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;&#2349;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2410;&#2413;&#2405;</p>
<p>47. By lessening the natural tendency (for restlessness) and
meditating on the unlimited, posture becomes firm and pleasant. </p>
<p>We can make the seat firm by thinking of the infinite. We
cannot think of the Absolute Infinite, but we can think of the infinite
sky. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2340;&#2379; &#2342;&#2381;&#2357;&#2344;&#2381;&#2342;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2344;&#2349;&#2367;&#2328;&#2366;&#2340;&#2307; &#2405;&#2410;&#2414;&#2405;</p>
<p>48. Seat being conquered, the dualities do not obstruct. </p>
<p>The dualities, good and bad, heat and cold, and all the pairs
of opposites, will not then disturb you. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2350;&#2367;&#2344;&#2381; &#2360;&#2340;&#2367; &#2358;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2360;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2358;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2360;&#2351;&#2379;&#2352;&#2381;&#2327;&#2340;&#2367;&#2357;&#2367;&#2330;&#2381;&#2331;&#2375;&#2342;&#2307; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2339;&#2366;&#2351;&#2366;&#2350;&#2307;

<p>49. Controlling the motion of the exhalation and the
inhalation follows after this. </p>
<p>When posture has been conquered, then the motion of the Prana
is to be broken and controlled. Thus we come to Pranayama, the
controlling of the vital forces of the body. Prana is not breath,
though it is usually so translated. It is the sum total of the cosmic
energy. It is the energy that is in each body, and its most apparent
manifestation is the motion of the lungs. This motion is caused by
Prana drawing in the breath, and it is what we seek to control in
Pranayama. We begin by controlling the breath, as the easiest way of
getting control of the Prana. </p>
<p>&#2348;&#2366;&#2361;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2349;&#2381;&#2351;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2352;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2350;&#2381;&#2349;&#2357;&#2371;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;&#2307; &#2342;&#2375;&#2358;&#2325;&#2366;&#2354;&#2360;&#2306;&#2326;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2349;&#2367;&#2307; &#2346;&#2352;&#2367;&#2342;&#2371;&#2359;&#2381;&#2335;&#2379;
&#2342;&#2368;&#2352;&#2381;&#2328;&#2360;&#2370;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2350;&#2307; &#2405;&#2411;&#2406;&#2405;</p>
<p>50. Its modifications are either external or internal, or
motionless, regulated by place, terns, and number, either long or
short. </p>
<p>The three sorts of motion of Pranayama are, one by which we
draw the breath in, another by which we throw it out, and the third
action is when the breath is held in the lungs, or stopped from
entering the lungs. These, again, are varied by place and time. By
place is meant that the Prana is held to some particular part of the
body. By time is meant how long the Prana should be confined to a
certain place, and so we are told how many seconds to keep one motion,
and how many seconds to keep another. The result of this Pranayama is
Udghâta, awakening the Kundalini. </p>
<p>&#2348;&#2366;&#2361;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2349;&#2381;&#2351;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2352;&#2357;&#2367;&#2359;&#2351;&#2366;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2375;&#2346;&#2368; &#2330;&#2340;&#2369;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2307; &#2405;&#2411;&#2407;&#2405;</p>
<p>51. The fourth is restraining the Prana by reflecting on
external or internal object. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 267'-->
<p>This is the fourth sort of Pranayama, in which the Kumbhaka is
brought about by long practice attended with reflection, which is
absent in the other three. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2340;&#2307; &#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2368;&#2351;&#2340;&#2375; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2325;&#2366;&#2358;&#2366;&#2357;&#2352;&#2339;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2411;&#2408;&#2405;</p>
<p>52. From that, the covering to the light of the Chitta is
attenuated. </p>
<p>The Chitta has, by its own nature, all knowledge. It is made
of Sattva particles, but is covered by Rajas and Tamas particles, and
by Pranayama this covering is removed.</p>
<p>&#2343;&#2366;&#2352;&#2339;&#2366;&#2360;&#2369; &#2330; &#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2381;&#2351;&#2340;&#2366; &#2350;&#2344;&#2360;&#2307; &#2405;&#2411;&#2409;&#2405;</p>
<p>53. The mind becomes fit for Dharana. </p>
<p>After this covering has been removed, we are able to
concentrate the mind. </p>
<p>&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2357;&#2367;&#2359;&#2351;&#2366;&#2360;&#2350;&#2381;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2375; &#2330;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2370;&#2346;&#2366;&#2344;&#2369;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352; &#2311;&#2357;&#2375;&#2344;&#2381;&#2342;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2351;&#2366;&#2339;&#2366;&#2306;
&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2361;&#2366;&#2352;&#2307; &#2405;&#2411;&#2410;&#2405;</p>
<p>54. The drawing in of the organs is by their giving up their
own objects and taking the form of the mind-stuff, as it were. </p>
<p>The organs are separate states of the mind-stuff. I see a
book; the form is not in the book, it is in the mind. Something is
outside which calls that form up. The real form is in the Chitta. The
organs identify themselves with, and take the forms of, whatever comes
to them. If you can restrain the mind-stuff from taking these forms,
the mind will remain calm. This is called Pratyahara. </p>
<p>&#2340;&#2340;&#2307; &#2346;&#2352;&#2350;&#2366; &#2357;&#2358;&#2381;&#2351;&#2340;&#2375;&#2344;&#2381;&#2342;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2351;&#2366;&#2339;&#2366;&#2350;&#2381; &#2405;&#2411;&#2411;&#2405;</p>
<p>55. Thence arises supreme control of the organs. </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 268'-->
<p>When the Yogi has succeeded in preventing the organs from
taking the forms of external objects, and in making them remain one
with the mind-stuff, then comes perfect control of the organs. When the
organs are perfectly under control, every muscle and nerve will be
under control, because the organs are the centres of all the
sensations, and of all actions. These organs are divided into organs of
work and organs of sensation. When the organs are controlled, the Yogi
can control all feeling and doing; the whole of the body comes under
his control. Then alone one begins to feel joy in being born; then one
can truthfully say, "Blessed am I that I was born." When that control
of the organs is obtained, we feel how wonderful this body really is.</p>
