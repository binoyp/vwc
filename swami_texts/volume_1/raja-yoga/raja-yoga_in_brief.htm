<h2>RAJA-YOGA IN BRIEF</h2>
<p>The following is a summary of Râja-Yoga freely translated from
the Kurma-Purâna. </p>
<p>The fire of Yoga burns the cage of sin that is around a man.
Knowledge becomes purified and Nirvâna is directly obtained. From Yoga
comes knowledge; knowledge again helps the Yogi. He who combines in
himself both Yoga and knowledge, with him the Lord is pleased. Those
that practice Mahâyoga, either once a day, or twice a day, or thrice,
or always, know them to be gods. Yoga is divided into two parts. One is
called Abhâva, and the other, Mahayoga. Where one's self is meditated
upon as zero, and bereft of quality, that is called Abhava. That in
which one sees the self as full of bliss and bereft of all impurities,
and one with God, is called Mahayoga. The Yogi, by each one, realises
his Self. The other Yogas that we read and hear of, do not deserve to
be ranked with the excellent Mahayoga in which the Yogi finds himself
and the whole universe as God. This is the highest of all Yogas.</p>
<p>Yama, Niyama, Âsana, Prânâyâma, Pratyâhâra, Dhârâna, Dhyâna,
and Samâdhi are the steps in Raja-Yoga, of which non-injury,
truthfulness, non-covetousness, chastity, not receiving anything from
another are called Yama. This purifies the mind, the Chitta. Never
producing pain by thought, word, and deed, in any living being, is what
is called Ahimsâ, non-injury. There is no virtue higher than
non-injury. There is no happiness higher than what a man obtains by
this attitude of non-offensiveness, to all creation. By truth we attain
fruits of work. Through truth everything is attained. In truth
everything is<!--'Volume 1 Page 190'--> established.
Relating facts as they are &#8212; this is truth. Not taking others' goods by
stealth or by force, is called Asteya, non-covetousness. Chastity in
thought, word, and deed, always, and in all conditions, is what is
called Brahmacharya. Not receiving any present from anybody, even when
one is suffering terribly, is what is called Aparigraha. The idea is,
when a man receives a gift from another, his heart becomes impure, he
becomes low, he loses his independence, he becomes bound and attached. </p>
<p>The following are helps to success in Yoga and are called
Niyama or regular habits and observances; Tapas, austerity; Svâdhyâya,
study; Santosha, contentment; Shaucha, purity; Ishvara-pranidhâna,
worshipping God. Fasting, or in other ways controlling the body, is
called physical Tapas. Repeating the Vedas and other Mantras, by which
the Sattva material in the body is purified, is called study,
Svadhyaya. There are three sorts of repetitions of these Mantras. One
is called the verbal, another semi-verbal, and the third mental. The
verbal or audible is the lowest, and the inaudible is the highest of
all. The repetition which is loud is the verbal; the next one is where
only the lips move, but no sound is heard. The inaudible repetition of
the Mantra, accompanied with the thinking of its meaning, is called the
"mental repetition," and is the highest. The sages have said that there
are two sorts of purification, external and internal. The purification
of the body by water, earth, or other materials is the external
purification, as bathing etc. Purification of the mind by truth, and by
all the other virtues, is what is called internal purification. Both
are necessary. It is not sufficient that a man should be internally
pure and externally dirty. When both are not attainable the internal
purity is the better, but no one will be a Yogi until he has both.
Worship of God is by praise, by thought, by devotion.</p>
<p>We have spoken about Yama and Niyama. The<!--'Volume 1 Page 191'-->
next is Asana (posture). The only thing to understand about it is
leaving the body free, holding the chest, shoulders, and head straight.
Then comes Pranayama. Prana means the vital forces in one's own body,
Âyâma means controlling them. There are three sorts of Pranayama, the
very simple, the middle, and the very high. Pranayama is divided into
three parts: filling, restraining, and emptying. When you begin with
twelve seconds it is the lowest Pranayama; when you begin with
twenty-four seconds it is the middle Pranayama; that Pranayama is the
best which begins with thirty-six seconds. In the lowest kind of
Pranayama there is perspiration, in the medium kind, quivering of the
body, and in the highest Pranayama levitation of the body and influx of
great bliss. There is a Mantra called the Gâyatri. It is a very holy
verse of the Vedas. "We meditate on the glory of that Being who has
produced this universe; may He enlighten our minds." Om is joined to it
at the beginning and the end. In one Pranayama repeat three Gayatris.
In all books they speak of Pranayama being divided into Rechaka
(rejecting or exhaling), Puraka (inhaling), and Kurnbhaka (restraining,
stationary). The Indriyas, the organs of the senses, are acting
outwards and coming in contact with external objects. Bringing them
under the control of the will is what is called Pratyahara or gathering
towards oneself. Fixing the mind on the lotus of the heart, or on the
centre of the head, is what is called Dharana. Limited to one spot,
making that spot the base, a particular kind of mental waves rises;
these are not swallowed up by other kinds of waves, but by degrees
become prominent, while all the others recede and finally disappear.
Next the multiplicity of these waves gives place to unity and one wave
only is left in the mind. This is Dhyana, meditation. When no basis is
necessary, when the whole of the mind has become one wave,
one-formedness, it is called Samadhi. Bereft<!--'Volume 1 Page 192'-->
of all help from places and centres, only the meaning of the thought is
present. If the mind can be fixed on the centre for twelve seconds it
will be a Dharana, twelve such Dharanas will be a Dhyana, and twelve
such Dhyanas will be a Samadhi.</p>
<p>Where there is fire, or in water or on ground which is strewn
with dry leaves, where there are many ant-hills, where there are wild
animals, or danger, where four streets meet, where there is too much
noise, where there are many wicked persons, Yoga must not be practiced.
This applies more particularly to India. Do not practice when the body
feels very lazy or ill, or when the mind is very miserable and
sorrowful. Go to a place which is well hidden, and where people do not
come to disturb you. Do not choose dirty places. Rather choose
beautiful scenery, or a room in your own house which is beautiful. When
you practice, first salute all the ancient Yogis, and your own Guru,
and God, and then begin. </p>
<p>Dhyana is spoken of, and a few examples are given of what to
meditate upon. Sit straight, and look at the tip of your nose. Later on
we shall come to know how that concentrates the mind, how by
controlling the two optic nerves one advances a long way towards the
control of the arc of reaction, and so to the control of the will. Here
are a few specimens of meditation. Imagine a lotus upon the top of the
head, several inches up, with virtue as its centre, and knowledge as
its stalk. The eight petals of the lotus are the eight powers of the
Yogi. Inside, the stamens and pistils are renunciation. If the Yogi
refuses the external powers he will come to salvation. So the eight
petals of the lotus are the eight powers, but the internal stamens and
pistils are extreme renunciation, the renunciation of all these powers.
Inside of that lotus think of the Golden One, the Almighty, the
Intangible, He whose name is Om, the Inexpressible, surrounded with
effulgent light. Meditate on that. Another meditation is given. Think
of<!--'Volume 1 Page 193'--> a space in your heart, and in
the midst of that space think that a flame is burning. Think of that
flame as your own soul and inside the flame is another effulgent light,
and that is the Soul of your soul, God. Meditate upon that in the
heart. Chastity, non-injury, forgiving even the greatest enemy, truth,
faith in the Lord, these are all different Vrittis. Be not afraid if
you are not perfect in all of these; work, they will come. He who has
given up all attachment, all fear, and all anger, he whose whole soul
has gone unto the Lord, he who has taken refuge in the Lord, whose
heart has become purified, with whatsoever desire he comes to the Lord,
He will grant that to him. Therefore worship Him through knowledge,
love, or renunciation. </p>
<p>"He who hates none, who is the friend of all, who is merciful
to all, who has nothing of his own, who is free from egoism, who is
even-minded in pain and pleasure, who is forbearing, who is always
satisfied, who works always in Yoga, whose self has become controlled,
whose will is firm, whose mind and intellect are given up unto Me, such
a one is My beloved Bhakta. From whom comes no disturbance, who cannot
be disturbed by others, who is free from joy, anger, fear, and anxiety,
such a one is My beloved. He who does not depend on anything, who is
pure and active, who does not care whether good comes or evil, and
never becomes miserable, who has given up all efforts for himself; who
is the same in praise or in blame, with a silent, thoughtful mind,
blessed with what little comes in his way, homeless, for the whole
world is his home, and who is steady in his ideas, such a one is My
beloved Bhakta." Such alone become Yogis. </p>

<p>There was a great god-sage called Nârada. Just as there are
sages among mankind, great Yogis, so there are great Yogis among the
gods. Narada was a good Yogi, and very great. He travelled everywhere.
One day he<!--'Volume 1 Page 194'--> was passing through a
forest, and saw a man who had been meditating until the white ants had
built a huge mound round his body &#8212; so long had he been sitting in that
position. He said to Narada, "Where are you going?" Narada replied, "I
am going to heaven." "Then ask God when He will be merciful to me; when
I shall attain freedom." Further on Narada saw another man. He was
jumping about, singing, dancing, and said, "Oh, Narada, where are you
going?" His voice and his gestures were wild. Narada said, "I am going
to heaven." "Then, ask when I shall be free." Narada went on. In the
course of time he came again by the same road, and there was the man
who had been meditating with the ant-hill round him. He said, "Oh,
Narada, did you ask the Lord about me?" "Oh, yes." "What did He say?"
"The Lord told me that you would attain freedom in four more births."
Then the man began to weep and wail, and said, "I have meditated until
an ant-hill has grown around me, and I have four more births yet!"
Narada went to the other man. "Did you ask my question?" "Oh, yes. Do
you see this tamarind tree? I have to tell you that as many leaves as
there are on that tree, so many times, you shall be born, and then you
shall attain freedom." The man began to dance for joy, and said, "I
shall have freedom after such a short time!" A voice came, "My child,
you will have freedom this minute." That was the reward for his
perseverance. He was ready to work through all those births, nothing
discouraged him. But the first man felt that even four more births were
too long. Only perseverance, like that of the man who was willing to
wait aeons brings about the highest result.</p>
