<h2>THE GITA II</h2>
<p>This article was recorded by Ida Ansell in shorthand. As,
however, Swamiji's speed was too great for her in her early days, dots
are put in the articles to indicate the omissions, while the words
within square brackets are added by way of linking up the disconnected
parts. </p>
<p class="center">(<i>Delivered in San Francisco, on
May 28, 1900</i>)</p>
<p>The Gitâ requires a little preliminary introduction. The scene
is laid on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. There were two branches of
the same race fighting for the empire of India about five thousand
years ago. The Pândavas had the right, but the Kauravas had the might.
The Pandavas were five brothers, and they were living in a forest.
Krishna was the friend of the Pandavas. The Kauravas would not grant
them as much land as would cover the point of a needle. </p>
<p>The opening scene is the battlefield, and both sides see their
relatives and friends &#8212; one brother on one side and another on the
other side; a grandfather on one side, grandson on the other side. ...
When Arjuna sees his own friends and relatives on the other side and
knows that he may have to kill them, his heart gives way and he says
that he will not fight. Thus begins the Gita. </p>
<p>For all of us in this world life is a continuous fight. ...
Many a time comes when we want to interpret our weakness and cowardice
as forgiveness and renunciation. There is no merit in the renunciation
of a beggar. If a person who can [give a blow] forbears, there is merit
in that. If a person who has, gives up, there is merit in that. We know
how often in our lives through laziness and cowardice we give up the
battle and try to hypnotise our minds into the belief that we are
brave. </p>
<p>The Gita opens with this very significant verse: "Arise, O
Prince! Give up this faint-heartedness, this weakness! Stand up and
fight!" (Gita, II. 3.) Then Arjuna, trying<!--'Volume 1 Page 460'-->
to argue the matter [with Krishna], brings higher moral ideas, how
non-resistance is better than resistance, and so on. He is trying to
justify himself, but he cannot fool Krishna. Krishna is the higher
Self, or God. He sees through the argument at once. In this case [the
motive] is weakness. Arjuna sees his own relatives and he cannot strike
them. ... </p>
<p>There is a conflict in Arjuna's heart between his emotionalism
and his duty. The nearer we are to [beasts and] birds, the more we are
in the hells of emotion. We call it love. It is self-hypnotisation. We
are under the control of our [emotions] like animals. A cow can
sacrifice its life for its young. Every animal can. What of that? It is
not the blind, birdlike emotion that leads to perfection. ... [To
reach] the eternal consciousness, that is the goal of man! There
emotion has no place, nor sentimentalism, nor anything that belongs to
the senses &#8212; only the light of pure reason. [There] man stands as
spirit. </p>
<p>Now, Arjuna is under the control of this emotionalism. He is
not what he should be &#8212; a great self-controlled, enlightened sage
working through the eternal light of reason. He has become like an
animal, like a baby, just letting his heart carry away his brain,
making a fool of himself and trying to cover his weakness with the
flowery names of "love" and so on. Krishna sees through that. Arjuna
talks like a man of little learning and brings out many reasons, but at
the same time he talks the language of a fool. </p>
<p>"The sage is not sorry for those that are living nor for those
that die." (Ibid. 11.) [Krishna says :] "You cannot die nor can I.
There was never a time when we did not exist. There will never be a
time when we shall not exist. As in this life a man begins with
childhood, and<!--'Volume 1 Page 461'--> [passes through
youth and old age, so at death he merely passes into another kind of
body]. Why should a wise man be sorry?" (Ibid. 12-13.) And where is the
beginning of this emotionalism that has got hold of you? It is in the
senses. "It is the touch of the senses that brings all this quality of
existence: heat and cold, pleasure and pain. They come and go." (Ibid.
14.) Man is miserable this moment, happy the next. As such he cannot
experience the nature of the soul. ... </p>
<p>"Existence can never be non-existence, neither can
non-existence ever become existence. ... Know, therefore, that that
which pervades all this universe is without beginning or end. It is
unchangeable. There is nothing in the universe that can change [the
Changeless]. Though this body has its beginning and end, the dweller in
the body is infinite and without end." (Ibid. 16-18.) </p>
<p>Knowing this, stand up and fight! Not one step back, that is
the idea. ... Fight it out, whatever comes. Let the stars move from the
sphere! Let the whole world stand against us! Death means only a change
of garment. What of it? Thus fight! You gain nothing by becoming
cowards. ... Taking a step backward, you do not avoid any misfortune.
You have cried to all the gods in the world. Has misery ceased? The
masses in India cry to sixty million gods, and still die like dogs.
Where are these gods? ... The gods come to help you when you have
succeeded. So what is the use? Die game. ... This bending the knee to
superstitions, this selling yourself to your own mind does not befit
you, my soul. You are infinite, deathless, birthless. Because you are
infinite spirit, it does not befit you to be a slave. ... Arise! Awake!
Stand up and fight! Die if you must. There is none to help you. You are
all the world. Who can help you? </p>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 462'-->
<p>"Beings are unknown to our human senses before birth and after
death. It is only in the interim that they are manifest. What is there
to grieve about? (Ibid. 28.) </p>
<p>"Some look at It [the Self] with wonder. Some talk of It as
wonderful. Others hear of It as wonderful. Others, hearing of It, do
not understand." (Ibid. 29.) </p>
<p>But if you say that killing all these people is sinful, then
consider this from the standpoint of your own caste-duty. ... "Making
pleasure and misery the same, making success and defeat the same, do
thou stand up and fight. (Ibid. 38.) </p>
<p>This is the beginning of another peculiar doctrine of the Gita
&#8212; the doctrine of non-attachment. That is to say, we have to bear the
result of our own actions because we attach ourselves to them. ...
"Only what is done as duty for duty's sake ... can scatter the bondage
of Karma." (Ibid. 39.) There is no danger that you can overdo it. ...
"If you do even a little of it, [this Yoga will save you from the
terrible round of birth and death]. (Ibid. 40.) </p>
<p><a name="v9_imitation"></a><!--'Volume 1 Page 462'-->
"Know, Arjuna, the mind that succeeds is the mind that is concentrated.
The minds that are taken up with two thousand subjects (have) their
energies dispersed. Some can talk flowery language and think there is
nothing beyond the Vedas. They want to go to heaven. They want good
things through the power of the Vedas, and so they make sacrifices."
(Ibid. 41-43.) Such will never attain any success [in spiritual life]
unless they give up all these materialistic ideas. (Ibid. 44.) </p>
<p>That is another great lesson. Spirituality can never be
attained unless all material ideas are given up. ... What is in the
senses? The senses are all delusion. People wish to retain them [in
heaven] even after they are dead &#8212; a pair of eyes, a nose. Some imagine
they<!--'Volume 1 Page 463'--> will have more organs than
they have now. They want to see God sitting on a throne through all
eternity &#8212; the material body of God. ... Such men's desires are for the
body, for food and drink and enjoyment. It is the materialistic life
prolonged. Man cannot think of anything beyond this life. This life is
all for the body. "Such a man never comes to that concentration which
leads to freedom." (Ibid. 44.) </p>
<p>"The Vedas only teach things belonging to the three Gunas, to
Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas." (Ibid. 45.) The Vedas only teach about
things in nature. People cannot think anything they do not see on
earth. If they talk about heaven, they think of a king sitting on a
throne, of people burning incense. It is all nature, nothing beyond
nature. The Vedas, therefore, teach nothing but nature. "Go beyond
nature, beyond the dualities of existence, beyond your own
consciousness, caring for nothing, neither for good nor for evil."
(Ibid. 45.) </p>
<p>We have identified ourselves with our bodies. We are only
body, or rather, possessed of a body. If I am pinched, I cry. All this
is nonsense, since I am the soul. All this chain of misery,
imagination, animals, gods, and demons, everything, the whole world all
this comes from the identification of ourselves with the body. I am
spirit. Why do I jump if you pinch me? ... Look at the slavery of it.
Are you not ashamed? We are religious! We are philosophers! We are
sages! Lord bless us! What are we? Living hells, that is what we are.
Lunatics, that is what we are! </p>
<p>We cannot give up the idea [of body]. We are earth-bound. ...
Our ideas are burial grounds. When we leave the body we are bound by
thousands of elements to those [ideas]. </p>
<p>Who can work without any attachment? That is the<!--'Volume 1 Page 464'-->
real question. Such a man is the same whether his work succeeds or
fails. His heart does not give one false beat even if his whole
life-work is burnt to ashes in a moment. "This is the sage who always
works for work's sake without caring for the results. Thus he goes
beyond the pain of birth and death. Thus he becomes free." (Ibid. 51.)
Then he sees that this attachment is all delusion. The Self can never
be attached. ... Then he goes beyond all the scriptures and
philosophies. (Ibid. 52.) If the mind is deluded and pulled into a
whirlpool by books and scriptures, what is the good of all these
scriptures? One says this, another says that. What book shall you take?
Stand alone! See the glory of your own soul, and see that you will have
to work. Then you will become a man of firm will. (Ibid. 53.) </p>
<p>Arjuna asks: "Who is a person of established will?" (Ibid.
54.) </p>
<p>[Krishna answers:] "The man who has given up all desires, who
desires nothing, not even this life, nor freedom, nor gods, nor work,
nor anything. When he has become perfectly satisfied, he has no more
cravings." (Ibid. 55.) He has seen the glory of the Self and has found
that the world, and the gods, and heaven are ... within his own Self.
Then the gods become no gods; death becomes no death; life becomes no
life. Everything has changed. "A man is said to be [illumined] if his
will has become firm, if his mind is not disturbed by misery, if he
does not desire any happiness, if he is free of all [attachment], of
all fear, of all anger. (Ibid. 56.) ... </p>
<p>"As the tortoise can draw in his legs, and if you strike him,
not one foot comes out, even so the sage can<!--'Volume 1 Page 465'-->
draw all his sense-organs inside," (Ibid. 58.) and nothing can force
them out. Nothing can shake him, no temptation or anything. Let the
universe tumble about him, it does not make one single ripple in his
mind. </p>
<p>Then comes a very important question. Sometimes people fast
for days. ... When the worst man has fasted for twenty days, he becomes
quite gentle. Fasting and torturing themselves have been practiced by
people all over the world. Krishna's idea is that this is all nonsense.
He says that the senses will for the moment recede from the man who
tortures himself, but will emerge again with twenty times more [power].
... What should you do? The idea is to be natural &#8212; no asceticism. Go
on, work, only mind that you are not attached. The will can never be
fixed strongly in the man who has not learnt and practiced the secret
of non-attachment. </p>
<p>I go out and open my eyes. If something is there, I must see
it. I cannot help it. The mind runs after the senses. Now the senses
must give up any reaction to nature. </p>
<p>"Where it is dark night for the [sense-bound] world, the self
controlled [man] is awake. It is daylight for him. ... And where the
world is awake, the sage sleeps." (Ibid. 69.) Where is the world awake?
In the senses. People want to eat and drink and have children, and then
they die a dog's death. ... They are always awake for the senses. Even
their religion is just for that. They invent a God to help them, to
give them more women, more money, more children &#8212; never a God to help
them become more godlike! "Where the whole world is awake, the sage
sleeps. But where the ignorant are asleep, there the sage keeps awake"
(Ibid. 69.) &#8212; in the world of light where man looks upon himself not as
a bird, not as an animal, not as a body, but as infinite spirit,
deathless, immortal.<!--'Volume 1 Page 466'--> There,
where the ignorant are asleep, and do not have time, nor intellect, nor
power to understand, there the sage is awake. That is daylight for him.
</p>
<p>"As all the rivers of the world constantly pour their waters
into the ocean, but the ocean's grand, majestic nature remains
undisturbed and unchanged, so even though all the senses bring in
sensations from nature, the ocean-like heart of the sage knows no
disturbance, knows no fear." (Ibid. 70.) Let miseries come in millions
of rivers and happiness in hundreds! I am no slave to misery! I am no
slave to happiness!</p>
