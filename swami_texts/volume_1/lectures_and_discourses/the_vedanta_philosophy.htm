<h2>THE VEDANTA PHILOSOPHY</h2>
<p>The Vedanta philosophy, as it is generally called at the
present day, really comprises all the various sects that now exist in
India. Thus there have been various interpretations, and to my mind
they have been progressive, beginning with the dualistic or Dvaita and
ending with the non-dualistic or Advaita. The word Vedanta literally
means the end of the Vedas &#8212; <a name="tx1"></a>the
Vedas being the scriptures of the
Hindus.<a class="fnote" href="#fn1">1</a><!--'Volume 1 Page 357'-->
Sometimes in the West by the Vedas are meant only the hymns and rituals
of the Vedas. But at the present time these parts have almost gone out
of use, and usually by the word Vedas in India, the Vedanta is meant.
All our commentators, when they want to quote a passage from the
scriptures, as a rule, quote from the Vedanta, which has another
technical name with the commentators &#8212; the Shrutis.&nbsp;(The term
Shruti &#8212; meaning "that which is heard" &#8212; though including the whole of
the Vedic literature, is chiefly applied by the commentators to the
Upanishads.) Now, all the books known by the name of the Vedanta were
not entirely written after the ritualistic portions of the Vedas. For
instance, one of them &#8212; the Ishâ Upanishad &#8212; forms the fortieth chapter
of the Yajur-Veda, that being one of the oldest parts of the Vedas.
<a name="tx2"></a>There are other Upanishads<a class="fnote" href="#fn2">2</a><!--'Volume 1 Page 357'-->
which form portions<!--'Volume 1 Page 358'--> of the
Brahmanas or ritualistic writings; and the rest of the Upanishads are
independent, not comprised in any of the Brahmanas or other parts of
the Vedas; but there is no reason to suppose that they were entirely
independent of other parts, for, as we well know, many of these have
been lost entirely and many of the Brahmanas have become extinct. So it
is quite possible that the independent Upanishads belonged to some
Brahmanas, which in course of time fell into disuse, while the
Upanishads remained. These Upanishads are also called Forest Books or
Aranyakas. </p>
<p>The Vedanta, then, practically forms the scriptures of the
Hindus, and all systems of philosophy that are orthodox have to take it
as their foundation. Even the Buddhists and Jains, when it suits their
purpose, will quote a passage from the Vedanta as authority. All
schools of philosophy in India, although they claim to have been based
upon the Vedas, took different names for their systems. The last one,
the system of Vyâsa, took its stand upon the doctrines of the Vedas
more than the previous systems did, and made an attempt to harmonise
the preceding philosophies, such as the Sânkhya and the Nyâya, with the
doctrines of the Vedanta. So it is especially called the Vedanta
philosophy; and the Sutras or aphorisms of Vyasa are, in modern India,
the basis of the Vedanta philosophy. Again, these Sutras of Vyasa have
been variously explained by different commentators. <a name="tx3"></a>In
general there
are three sorts of commentators<a class="fnote" href="#fn3">3</a><!--'Volume 1 Page 358'-->
in India now;<!--'Volume 1 Page 359'--> from their
interpretations have arisen three systems of philosophy and sects. One
is the dualistic, or Dvaita; a second is the qualified non-dualistic,
or Vishishtâdvaita; and a third is the non-dualistic, or Advaita. Of
these the dualistic and the qualified non-dualistic include the largest
number of the Indian people. The non-dualists are comparatively few in
number. Now I will try to lay before you the ideas that are contained
in all these three sects; but before going on, I will make one remark &#8212;
that these different Vedanta systems have one common psychology, and
that is, the psychology of the Sankhya system. The Sankhya psychology
is very much like the psychologies of the Nyaya and Vaisheshika
systems, differing only in minor particulars. </p>
<p>All the Vedantists agree on three points. They believe in God,
in the Vedas as revealed, and in cycles. We have already considered the
Vedas. The belief about cycles is as follows: All matter throughout the
universe is<!--'Volume 1 Page 360'--> the outcome of one
primal matter called Âkâsha; and all force, whether gravitation,
attraction or repulsion, or life, is the outcome of one primal force
called Prâna. <a name="tx4"></a>Prana acting on
Akasha is creating or projecting<a class="fnote" href="#fn4">4</a>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 360'-->the universe. At the beginning
of a cycle, Akasha is motionless,
unmanifested. Then Prana begins to act, more and more, creating grosser
and grosser forms out of Akasha &#8212; plants, animals, men, stars, and so
on. After an incalculable time this evolution ceases and involution
begins, everything being resolved back through finer and finer forms
into the original Akasha and Prana, when a new cycle follows. Now there
is something beyond Akasha and Prana. Both can be resolved into a third
thing called Mahat &#8212; the Cosmic Mind. This Cosmic Mind does not create
Akasha and Prana, but changes itself into them. </p>
<p>We will now take up the beliefs about mind, soul, and God.
According to the universally accepted Sankhya psychology, in perception
&#8212; in the case of vision, for instance &#8212; there are, first of all, the
instruments of vision, the eyes. Behind the instruments &#8212; the eyes &#8212; is
the organ of vision or Indriya &#8212; the optic nerve and its centres &#8212;
which is not the external instrument, but without which the eyes will
not see. More still is needed for perception. The mind or Manas must
come and attach itself to the organ. And besides this, the sensation
must be carried to the intellect or Buddhi &#8212; the determinative,
reactive state of the mind. When the reaction comes from Buddhi, along
with it flashes the external world and egoism. Here then is the will;
but everything is not complete. Just as every picture, being composed
of successive impulses of light, must be united on something stationary
<!--'Volume 1 Page 361'-->to form a whole, so all the
ideas in the mind must be gathered and
projected on something that is stationary &#8212; relatively to the body and
mind &#8212; that is, on what is called the Soul or Purusha or Âtman. </p>
<p>According to the Sankhya philosophy, the reactive state of the
mind called Buddhi or intellect is the outcome, the change, or a
certain manifestation of the Mahat or Cosmic Mind. The Mahat becomes
changed into vibrating thought; and that becomes in one part changed
into the organs, and in the other part into the fine particles of
matter. Out of the combination of all these, the whole of this universe
is produced. Behind even Mahat, the Sankhya conceives of a certain
state which is called Avyakta or unmanifested, where even the
manifestation of mind is not present, but only the causes exist. It is
also called Prakriti. Beyond this Prakriti, and eternally separate from
it, is the Purusha, the soul of the Sankhya which is without attributes
and omnipresent. The Purusha is not the doer but the witness. The
illustration of the crystal is used to explain the Purusha. The latter
is said to be like a crystal without any colour, before which different
colours are placed, and then it seems to be coloured by the colours
before it, but in reality it is not. The Vedantists reject the Sankhya
ideas of the soul and nature. They claim that between them there is a
huge gulf to be bridged over. On the one hand the Sankhya system comes
to nature, and then at once it has to jump over to the other side and
come to the soul, which is entirely separate from nature. How can these
different colours, as the Sankhya calls them, be able to act on that
soul which by its nature is colourless? <a name="tx5"></a>So
the Vedantists, from the
very first affirm that this soul and this nature are one.<a class="fnote" href="#fn5">5</a>
<!--'Volume 1 Page 361'-->Even the dualistic<!--'Volume 1 Page 362'-->
Vedantists
admit that the Atman or God is not only the efficient cause of this
universe, but also the material cause. But they only say so in so many
words. They do not really mean it, for they try to escape from their
conclusions, in this way: They say there are three existences in this
universe &#8212; God, soul, and nature. Nature and soul are, as it were, the
body of God, and in this sense it may be said that God and the whole
universe are one. But this nature and all these various souls remain
different from each other through all eternity. Only at the beginning
of a cycle do they become manifest; and when the cycle ends, they
become fine, and remain in a fine state. The Advaita Vedantists &#8212; the
non-dualists &#8212; reject this theory of the soul, and, having nearly the
whole range of the Upanishads in their favour, build their philosophy
entirely upon them. All the books contained in me Upanishads have one
subject, one task before them &#8212; to prove the following theme: "Just as
by the knowledge of one lump of clay we have the knowledge of all the
clay in the universe, so what is that, knowing which we know everything
in the universe?" The idea of the Advaitists is to generalise the whole
universe into one &#8212; that something which is really the whole of this
universe. And they claim that this whole universe is one, that it is
one Being manifesting itself in all these various forms. They admit
that what the Sankhya calls nature exists, but say that nature is God.
It is this Being, the Sat, which has become converted into all this &#8212;
the universe, man, soul, and everything that exists. Mind and Mahat are
but the manifestations of that one Sat. But then the difficulty arises
that this would be pantheism. How came that Sat which is unchangeable,
as they admit (for that which is absolute is<!--'Volume 1 Page 363'-->
unchangeable), to be changed into that which is changeable, and
perishable? The Advaitists here have a theory which they call Vivarta
Vâda or apparent manifestation. According to the dualists and the
Sankhyas, the whole of this universe is the evolution of primal nature.
According to some of the Advaitists and some of the dualists, the whole
of this universe is evolved from God. And according to the Advaitists
proper, the followers of Shankaracharya, the whole universe is the <i>apparent</i>
evolution of God. God is the material cause of this universe, but not
really, only apparently. The celebrated illustration used is that of
the rope and the snake, where the rope appeared to be the snake, but
was not really so. The rope did not really change into the snake. Even
so this whole universe as it exists is that Being. It is unchanged, and
all the changes we see in it are only apparent. These changes are
caused by Desha, Kâla and Nimitta (space, time, and causation), or,
according to a higher psychological generalization, by Nâma and Rupa
(name and form). It is by name and form that one thing is
differentiated from another. The name and form alone cause the
difference. In reality they are one and the same. Again, it is not, the
Vedantists say, that there is something as phenomenon and something as
noumenon. The rope is changed into the snake apparently only; and when
the delusion ceases, the snake vanishes. When one is in ignorance, he
sees the phenomenon and does not see God. When he sees God, this
universe vanishes entirely for him. Ignorance or Mâyâ, as it is called,
is the cause of all this phenomenon &#8212; the Absolute, the Unchangeable,
being taken as this manifested universe. This Maya is not absolute
zero, nor non-existence. It is defined as neither existence nor
non-existence. It is not existence, because that can be said only of
the Absolute, the Unchangeable, and in this sense, Maya is
non-existence. Again, it cannot be said it is non-existence; for if it
were, it could never<!--'Volume 1 Page 364'--> produce
phenomenon. So it is something which is neither; and in the Vedanta
philosophy it is called Anirvachaniya or inexpressible. Maya, then, is
the real cause of this universe. Maya gives the name and form to what
Brahman or God gives the material; and the latter seems to have been
transformed into all this. The Advaitists, then, have no place for the
individual soul. They say individual souls are created by Maya. In
reality they cannot exist. If there were only one existence throughout,
how could it be that I am one, and you are one, and so forth? We are
all one, and the cause of evil is the perception of duality. As soon as
I begin to feel that I am separate from this universe, then first comes
fear, and then comes misery. "Where one hears another, one sees
another, that is small. Where one does not see another, where one does
not hear another, that is the greatest, that is God. In that greatest
is perfect happiness. In small things there is no happiness." </p>
<p>According to the Advaita philosophy, then, this
differentiation of matter, these phenomena, are, as it were, for a
time, hiding the real nature of man; but the latter really has not been
changed at all. In the lowest worm, as well as in the highest human
being, the same divine nature is present. The worm form is the lower
form in which the divinity has been more overshadowed by Maya; that is
the highest form in which it has been least overshadowed. Behind
everything the same divinity is existing, and out of this comes the
basis of morality. Do not injure another. Love everyone as your own
self, because the whole universe is one. In injuring another, I am
injuring myself; in loving another, I am loving myself. From this also
springs that principle of Advaita morality which has been summed up in
one word &#8212; self-abnegation. The Advaitist says, this little
personalised self is the cause of all my misery. This individualised
self, which makes me different from all other beings, brings hatred and
<!--'Volume 1 Page 365'-->jealousy and misery, struggle
and all other evils. And when this idea
has been got rid of, all struggle will cease, all misery vanish. So
this is to be given up. We must always hold ourselves ready, even to
give up our lives for the lowest beings. When a man has become ready
even to give up his life for a little insect, he has reached the
perfection which the Advaitist wants to attain; and at that moment when
he has become thus ready, the veil of ignorance falls away from him,
and he will feel his own nature. Even in this life, he will feel that
he is one with the universe. For a time, as it were, the whole of this
phenomenal world will disappear for him, and he will realise what he
is. But so long as the Karma of this body remains, he will have to
live. This state, when the veil has vanished and yet the body remains
for some time, is what the Vedantists call the Jivanmukti, the living
freedom. If a man is deluded by a mirage for some time, and one day the
mirage disappears &#8212; if it comes back again the next day, or at some
future time, he will not be deluded. Before the mirage first broke, the
man could not distinguish between the reality and the deception. But
when it has once broken, as long as he has organs and eyes to work
with, he will see the image, but will no more be deluded. That fine
distinction between the actual world and the mirage he has caught, and
the latter cannot delude him any more. So when the Vedantist has
realised his own nature, the whole world has vanished for him. It will
come back again, but no more the same world of misery. The prison of
misery has become changed into Sat, Chit, Ânanda &#8212; Existence Absolute,
Knowledge Absolute, Bliss Absolute &#8212; and the attainment of this is the
goal of the Advaita Philosophy. </p>

<ol class="fnote">
<li><a href="#tx1">^</a><a name="fn1"></a>The
Vedas are divided mainly into two portions: the Karma-kânda and the
Jnâna-kânda &#8212; the work-portion and the knowledge-portion. To the
Karma-kanda belong the famous hymns and the rituals of Brâhmanas. Those
books which treat of spiritual matters apart from ceremonials are
called Upanishads. The Upanishads belong to the Jnana-kanda, or
knowledge-portion. It is not that all the Upanishads were composed as a
separate portion of the Vedas. Some are interspersed among the rituals,
and at least one is in the Samhita, or hymn-portion. Sometimes the term
Upanishad is applied to books which are not included in the Vedas &#8212; e.g
the Gita, but as a rule it is applied to the philosophical treatises
scattered through the Vedas. These treatises have been collected, and
are called the Vedanta.</li>
<li><a href="#tx2">^</a><a name="fn2"></a>The
Upanishads are said to be one hundred and eight in number. Their dates
cannot be fixed with certainty &#8212; only it is certain that they are older
than the Buddhistic movement. Though some of the minor Upanishads
contain allusions indicating a later date, yet that does not prove the
later date of the treatise, as in very many cases in Sanskrit
literature, the substance of a book, though of very ancient date,
receives a coating, as it were, of later events in the hands of the
sectarians, to exalt their particular sect.</li>
<li><a href="#tx3">^</a><a name="fn3"></a>The
commentaries are of various sorts such as the Bhâshya, Tikâ, Tippani,
Churni, etc., of which all except the Bhashya are explanations of the
text or difficult words in the text. The Bhashya is not properly a
commentary, but the elucidation of a system of philosophy out of texts,
the object being not to explain the words, but to bring out a
philosophy. So the writer of a Bhashya expands his own system, taking
texts as authorities for his system. There have been various
commentaries on the Vedanta. Its doctrines found their final expression
in the philosophical aphorisms of Vyasa. This treatise, called the
Uttara Mimâmsâ, is the standard authority of Vedantism &#8212; nay, is the
most authoritative exposition of the Hindu scriptures. The most
antagonistic sects have been compelled, as it were, to take up the
texts of Vyasa, and harmonise them with their own philosophy. Even in
very ancient times the commentators on the Vedanta philosophy formed
themselves into the three celebrated Hindu sects of dualists, qualified
non-dualists, and non dualists. The ancient commentaries are perhaps
lost; but they have been revived in modern times by the post-Buddhistic
commentators, Shankara, Râmânuja, and Madhva. Shankara revived the
nondualistic form, Ramanuja, the qualified non-dualistic form of the
ancient commentator Bodhayana; and Madhva, the dualistic form. In India
the sects differ mainly in their philosophy; the difference in rituals
is slight, the basis of their philosophy and religion being the same.</li>
<li><a href="#tx4">^</a><a name="fn4"></a>The
word which is "creation", in the English language is in Sanskrit
exactly "projection," because there is no sect in India which believes
in creation as it is regarded in the West &#8212; a something coming out of
nothing. What we mean by creation is projection of that which already
existed.</li>
<li><a href="#tx5">^</a><a name="fn5"></a>The
Vedanta and the Sankhya philosophy are very little opposed to each
other. The Vedanta God developed out of the Sankhya's Purusha. All the
systems take up the psychology of the Sankhya. Both the Vedanta and the
Sankhya believe in the infinite soul, only the Sankhya believes there
are many souls. According to the Sankhya, this universe does not
require any explanation from outside. The Vedanta believes that there
is the one Soul, which appears as many; and we build on the Sankhya's
analysis.</li>
