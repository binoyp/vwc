<h2>RELIGION NOT THE CRYING NEED OF INDIA</h2>
<p class="center"><i>20th September, 1893</i></p>
<p>Christians must always be ready for good criticism, and I
hardly think that you will mind if I make a little criticism. You
Christians, who are so fond of sending out missionaries to save the
soul of the heathen &#8212; why do you not try to save their bodies from
starvation? In India, during the terrible famines, thousands died from
hunger, yet you Christians did nothing. You erect churches all through
India, but the crying evil in the East is not religion &#8212; they have
religion enough &#8212; but it is bread that the suffering millions of
burning India cry out for with parched throats. They ask us for bread,
but we give them stones. It is an insult to a starving people to offer
them religion; it is an insult to a starving man to teach him
metaphysics. In India a priest that preached for money would lose caste
and be spat upon by the people. I came here to seek aid for my
impoverished people, and I fully realised how difficult it was to get
help for heathens from Christians in a Christian land.</p>
